Expressions
===========

Expressions allow to manipulate, query, and modify data in EdgeQL.

All expressions evaluate to sets of *objects*, *atomic values*,
*array*, *maps*, or *tuples*. Depending on the set sizes of the
operands, operations produce different sets of results.


Set and element operations
--------------------------

EdgeDB has two kinds of inputs on which operations are defined: sets
and elements.

+-------------------------------+-------------------------------+
| Set                           | Element                       |
+===============================+===============================+
| - statements (and clauses)    | - OR, AND, NOT                |
| - UNION, UNION ALL, DISTINCT  | - =, !=                       |
| - EXISTS                      | - <, >, <=, >=                |
| - IF..ELSE                    | - LIKE, ILIKE                 |

|                               | - all regular functions       |
|                               | - creating an array           |
|                               | - creating a tuple            |
+-------------------------------+-------------------------------+

Set operations treat empty set ``{}`` as one of the possible valid
inputs, but otherwise not very special.

Element operations work on set elements as opposed to sets. So
to reconcile that with the fact that everything is a set in EdgeQL we
define the application of an element operation in the following manner:

.. note::

    Given and *n-ary* operation *op* and A\ :sub:`1`, ..., A\ :sub:`n`
    ⊆ U, define the result set of applying the operation as:

    :emphasis:`op`\ (A\ :sub:`1`, ..., A\ :sub:`n`) ≡
    { :emphasis:`op`\ (t): ∀ t ∈ A\ :sub:`1` ⨉ ... ⨉ A\ :sub:`n` }

One of the consequences of this definition is that it gives a way to
measure the maximum cardinality of the result set for a given element
operation and input sets.

Another consequence of the above definition is that if any of the
operand sets for a element operation is ``{}``, the result is also
``{}`` (since there are no elements produced in the Cartesian
product). This is particularly important for comparisons and boolean
logic operations as all of the following evaluate to ``{}``:

.. code-block:: eql

    SELECT TRUE OR {};
    SELECT FALSE AND {};
    SELECT {} = {};

This can lead to subtle mistakes when using actual paths that involve
non-required links (or the roots of which might not exists):

.. code-block:: eql

    # will evaluate to {} if either 'a' or 'b' link is missing on a
    # given object Foo
    SELECT Foo.a OR Foo.b;

When the desired behavior is to treat ``{}`` as equivalent to
``FALSE``, the coalesce ``??`` operator should be used:

.. code-block:: eql

    # will treat missing 'a' or 'b' links as equivalent to FALSE
    SELECT Foo.a ?? FALSE OR Foo.b ?? FALSE;


Operations and paths
--------------------

There is some important interaction of the rule of
:ref:`longest common prefix<ref_edgeql_paths_prefix>`
for paths and operation cardinality. Consider the following example:

.. code-block:: eql

    SELECT Issue.status.name + Issue.number;

The expression ``Issue.status.name`` is a set of all strings, that are
reachable from any ``Issue`` by following the link ``status`` and then
``name``. Because the link ``status`` has the default cardinality of
``*1`` and so does the link ``name`` overall the expression has the
same cardinality as the set of ``Issues``. Similarly, as a separate
expression ``Issue.number`` would have the same cardinality as
``Issues``. However, due to the common prefix rule that states that a
common prefix denotes *the same* object the operation ``+`` is not
applied to the cross-product of the set ``Issue.status.name`` and
``Issue.number`` as if they were independent. Instead for every common
prefix (``Issue`` in this case), the operation is applied to the
cross-product of the subsets denoted by the remainder of the operand
paths. For the sample query, these subsets happen to be singleton sets
for every ``Issue``, because all the links followed from ``Issue``
have the default cardinality ``*1``, pointing to singleton sets. Thus
the result of the operation for each ``Issue`` is also a singleton set
and the overall cardinality of the expression ``Issue.status.name +
Issue.number`` is the same as the cardinality of ``Issues``.

Set operations
--------------

Statements and clauses are effectively set operations and are
discussed in more details in the
:ref:`Statements<ref_edgeql_statements>` section.

Basic set operators:

- DISTINCT

    ``DISTINCT`` is a set operator that returns a new set where no
    member is equal to any other member. Considering that any two
    objects are equal if and only if they have the same identity (that
    is to say, the value of an object is equal to its identity), this
    operator is mainly useful when applied to sets of atomic values
    (or any other non-object, such as an array or tuple).

- UNION ALL

    ``UNION ALL`` is only valid for sets of atoms. It performs the set
    union where atoms are compared by *identity* (in all other cases
    comparisons are made by *value*). So effectively it merges two
    sets of atoms keeping all of the members.

    For example, if we use ``UNION ALL`` on two sets ``{1, 2, 2}`` and
    ``{2}``, we'll get the set ``{1, 2, 2, 2}``.

- UNION

    ``UNION`` is a set operator that performs the set union where
    members are compared by *value*. This operation works out
    intuitively for objects because their identity and value are
    equivalent. For atoms it is equivalent to: ``DISTINCT (A UNION ALL
    B)``. In particular that means that:

    ``{1, 2} UNION {2, 3}`` ≡ ``{1, 2, 3}``

    ``{User1, User2} UNION {User1, User3}`` ≡ ``{User1, User2, User3}``

    ``A UNION A UNION A`` ≡ ``A UNION A`` ≡ ``DISTINCT A``

    .. note::

        The main reason why ``UNION`` works like this is that EdgeDB
        is optimized for working with sets of objects. So the simpler
        ``UNION`` operator must work intuitively with those sets. It
        would be very confusing if:

        ``(A UNION B).id`` ≢ ``A.id UNION B.id``

        Conversely, non-objects (e.g. atomic values) are treated
        specially from the beginning so having a special variant
        operator ``UNION ALL`` to preserve the set semantics they
        follow allows to consistently indicate that indeed all the
        individual values are desired throughout the computation.

- EXISTS

    ``EXISTS`` is a set operator that returns a singleton set
    ``{TRUE}`` if the input set is not ``{}`` and returns
    ``{FALSE}`` otherwise.

    .. note::

        Technically, ``EXISTS`` behaves like a special built-in
        :ref:`aggregate function<ref_edgeql_expressions_agg>`. It is
        sufficiently basic and a special case that it is an *operator*
        unlike a built-in aggregate function ``count``.

- IF..ELSE

    It's worth noting that ``IF..ELSE`` is a kind of syntax sugar for
    the following expression:

    .. code-block:: eql

        # SELECT a IF cond ELSE b is equivalent to the below:
        SELECT
            (SELECT a FILTER cond)
            UNION
            (SELECT b FILTER NOT cond);

    .. XXX is it really? what about UNION ALL version?

    One of the consequences of this is that if the ``cond`` expression
    is ``{}``, the whole choice expression evaluates to ``{}``.

.. _ref_edgeql_expressions_coalesce:

- Coalescing

    Coalescing ``a ?? b`` is, in fact, perfectly equivalent to:

    .. code-block:: eql

        SELECT a IF EXISTS a ELSE b;

    A typical use case of coalescing operator is to provide default
    values for optional links.

    .. code-block:: eql

        # get a set of tuples (<issue name>, <priority>) for all
        # issues
        WITH MODULE example
        SELECT (Issue.name, Issue.priority.name ?? 'n/a');

    Without the coalescing operator the above query would skip any
    ``Issue`` without priority.


.. _ref_edgeql_expressions_agg:

Aggregate functions
-------------------

Aggregate functions are *set functions* mapping arbitrary sets onto
singletons. Examples of aggregate functions include built-ins such as
``count`` and ``array_agg``.

.. code-block:: eql

    # count maps a set to an integer, specifically it returns the
    # number of elements in a set
    SELECT count(example::Issue);

    # array_agg maps a set to an array of the same type, specifically
    # it returns the array made from all of the set elements (which
    # can also be ordered)
    WITH MODULE example
    SELECT array_agg(Issue ORDER BY Issue.number);


Element operations
------------------

Element operations are largely represented by various operators. Most
of these operators require their operands to be of the same
:ref:`type<ref_edgeql_types>`.

- boolean operators ``OR``, ``AND``, ``NOT``

- value equality operators ``=`` and ``!=``

- comparison operators ``<``, ``>``, ``<=``, ``>=``

- string matching operators ``LIKE`` and ``ILIKE`` that work exactly the
  same way as in SQL

- set membership operators ``IN`` and ``NOT IN`` that test whether the
  left operand is an element in the right operand, for each element of
  the left operand

  .. code-block:: eql

    SELECT 1 IN {1, 3, 5};
    # returns [True]

    SELECT 'Alice' IN User.name;

- type-checking operators ``IS`` and ``IS NOT`` that test whether the
  left operand is of any of the types given by the comma-separated
  list of types provided as the right operand

  .. code-block:: eql

    SELECT 1 IS int;
    # returns [True]

    SELECT User IS NOT SystemUser
    FILTER User.name = 'Alice';
    # returns [True]

    SELECT User IS (Text, Named);
    # returns [True, ..., True], one for every user

- arithmetic operators ``+``, ``-``, ``*``, ``/``, ``%`` (modulo),
  ``^`` (power)


Regular functions
-----------------

Many built-in functions and user-defined functions operate on
elements, so they are also element operations. This implies that if
any of the input sets are empty, the result of applying an element
function is also empty.


Array or tuple creation
-----------------------

Creating an array or tuple via ``[...]`` or ``(...)`` is an element
operation. One way of thinking about these constructors is to treat
them exactly like functions that simply turn their arguments into an
array or a tuple, respectively.

This means that the following code will create a set of tuples with
the first element being ``Issue`` and the second a ``str``
representing the ``Issue.priority.name``:

.. code-block:: eql

    WITH MODULE example
    SELECT (Issue, Issue.priority.name);

Since ``priority`` is not a required link, not every ``Issue`` will
have one. It is important to realize that the above query will *only*
contain Issues with non-empty priorities. If it is desirable to have
*all* Issues, then :ref:`coalescing<ref_edgeql_expressions_coalesce>`
or a :ref:`shape<ref_edgeql_shapes>` query should be used instead.

On the other hand the following query will include *all* Issues,
because the tuple elements are made from the set of Issues and the set
produced by the aggregator function ``array_agg``, which is never
``{}``:

.. code-block:: eql

    WITH MODULE example
    SELECT (Issue, array_agg(Issue.priority.name));

All of the above works the same way for arrays.
