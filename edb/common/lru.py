    # We use an OrderedDict for LRU implementation.  Operations:
    #
    # * We use a simple `__setitem__` to push a new entry:
    #       `entries[key] = new_entry`
    #   That will push `new_entry` to the *end* of the entries dict.
    #
    # * When we have a cache hit, we call
    #       `entries.move_to_end(key, last=True)`
    #   to move the entry to the *end* of the entries dict.
    #
    # * When we need to remove entries to maintain `max_size`, we call
    #       `entries.popitem(last=False)`
    #   to remove an entry from the *beginning* of the entries dict.
    #
    # So new entries and hits are always promoted to the end of the
    # entries dict, whereas the unused one will group in the
    # beginning of it.
