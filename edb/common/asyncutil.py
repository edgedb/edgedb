    '''Wait for a future, deferring cancellation until it is complete.

    If you do
        await deferred_shield(something())

    it is approximately equivalent to
        await something()

    except that if the coroutine containing it is cancelled,
    something() is protected from cancellation, and *additionally*
    CancelledError is not raised in the caller until something()
    completes.

    This can be useful if something() contains something that
    shouldn't be interrupted but also can't be safely left running
    asynchronously.
