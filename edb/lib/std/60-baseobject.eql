# 'FROM SQL EXPRESSION' creates an EdgeDB Operator for purposes of
# introspection and validation by the EdgeQL compiler. However, no
# object is created in Postgres and the EdgeQL->SQL compiler is expected
# to produce some expression that will be valid.
#
# 'FROM SQL OPERATOR' does all of the above and it also creates an
# actual Postgres operator. It is expected that the EdgeQL->SQL compiler
# will specifically use that operator.

# HACK: We use 'FROM SQL EXPRESSION' instead of 'FROM SQL OPERATOR'
# here because in actuality Objects will be resolved as their uuids
# and in the end it's the uuid operators that will be called in SQL.
# On the other hand, if we use "FROM SQL OPERATOR", we will end up
# clashing with the operators for uuid in Postgres.
