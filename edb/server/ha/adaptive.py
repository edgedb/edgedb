    # Adaptive HA support is used to detect HA backends that does not actively
    # send clear failover signals to EdgeDB. It can be enabled through command
    # line argument --enable-backend-adaptive-ha.
    #
    # This class evaluates the events on the backend connection pool into 3
    # states representing the status of the backend:
    #
    #   * Healthy - all is good
    #   * Unhealthy - a staging state before failover
    #   * Failover - backend failover is in process
    #
    # When entering Unhealthy state, we will start to count events for a
    # threshold; when reached, we'll switch to Failover state - that means we
    # will actively disconnect all backend connections and wait for sys_pgcon
    # to reconnect. In any of the 3 states, client connections will not be
    # dropped. Whether the clients could issue queries is irrelevant to the 3
    # states - `BackendUnavailableError` or `BackendInFailoverError` is only
    # raised if the sys_pgcon is broken. But even with that said,
    # `BackendUnavailableError` is only seen in Unhealthy (not always), and
    # Failover always means `BackendInFailoverError` for any queries.
    #
    # Rules of state switches:
    #
    # Unhealthy -> Healthy
    #   * Successfully connected to a non-hot-standby backend.
    #   * Data received from any pgcon (not implemented).
    #
    # Unhealthy -> Failover
    #   * More than 60% (UNEXPECTED_DISCONNECTS_THRESHOLD) of existing pgcons
    #     are "unexpectedly disconnected" (number of existing pgcons is
    #     captured at the moment we change to Unhealthy state, and maintained
    #     on "expected disconnects" too).
    #   * (and) In Unhealthy state for more than UNHEALTHY_MIN_TIME seconds.
    #   * (and) sys_pgcon is down.
    #   * (or) Postgres shutdown/hot-standby notification received.
    #
    # Healthy -> Unhealthy
    #   * Any unexpected disconnect.
    #   * (or) Failed to connect due to ConnectionError (not implemented).
    #   * (or) Last active time is greater than 10 seconds (depends on the
    #     sys_pgcon idle-poll interval) (not implemented).
    #
    # Healthy -> Failover
    #   * Postgres shutdown/hot-standby notification received.
    #
    # Failover -> Healthy
    #   * Successfully connected to a non-hot-standby backend.
    #   * (and) sys_pgcon is healthy.
