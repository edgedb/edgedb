    Split the input string into a list of possible EdgeQL statements.

    No parsing is done, so the statements may be invalid. Lexing
    exceptions will not be raised at this stage.

    The return value is a 2-tuple (`out`, `incomplete`). The `out`
    value is the list of all statements that were detected based on
    the statement separator `;`. The `incomplete` value is None when
    *script_mode* is False. When *script_mode* is True, the
    `incomplete` value may contain a string representing the trailing
    incomplete statement or None if no trailing incomplete statement
    is detected.
