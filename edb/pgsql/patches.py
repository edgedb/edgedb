    Patches that modify the schema class layout and introspection queries

    suffix to the names of the core instdata entries that we would need to
    update, so that we don't clobber the old version.

    After a downgrade, we'll have more patches applied than we
    actually know exist in the running version, but since we compute
    the key based on the number of schema layout patches that we can
    *see*, we still compute the right key.
