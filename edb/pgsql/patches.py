    update, so that we don't clobber the old version.

    the key based on the number of schema layout patches that we can

The actual list of patches. The patches are (kind, script) pairs.

The current kinds are:
 * sql - simply runs a SQL script
 * metaschema-sql - create a function from metaschema
 * edgeql - runs an edgeql DDL command
 * edgeql+schema - runs an edgeql DDL command and updates the std schemas
 * edgeql+user_ext|<extname> - updates extensions installed in user databases
 *                           - should be paired with an ext-pkg patch
 * ...+config - updates config views
 * ext-pkg - installs an extension package given a name
 * repair - fix up inconsistencies in *user* schemas
 * sql-introspection - refresh all sql introspection views
