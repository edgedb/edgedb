class NodeTransformer(visitor.NodeVisitor):
    """Walks the abstract syntax tree and allows modification of nodes.

    The `NodeTransformer` will walk the AST and use the return value of the
    visitor methods to replace or remove the old node.  If the return value of
    the visitor method is ``None``, the node will be removed from its location,
    otherwise it is replaced with the return value.  The return value may be
    the original node in which case no replacement takes place.

    Here is an example transformer that rewrites all occurrences of name
    lookups (``foo``) to ``data['foo']``::

       class RewriteName(NodeTransformer):

           def visit_Name(self, node):
               return copy_location(Subscript(
                   value=Name(id='data', ctx=Load()),
                   slice=Index(value=Str(s=node.id)),
                   ctx=node.ctx
               ), node)

    Keep in mind that if the node you're operating on has child nodes you must
    either transform the child nodes yourself or call the :meth:`generic_visit`
    method for the node first.

    For nodes that were part of a collection of statements (that applies to all
    statement nodes), the visitor may also return a list of nodes rather than
    just a single node.

    Usually you use the transformer like this::

       node = YourTransformer().visit(node)
    """

    def generic_visit(self, node):
        for field, old_value in base.iter_fields(node, include_meta=False):
            old_value = getattr(node, field, None)

            if base.is_container(old_value):
                new_values = old_value.__class__(self.visit(old_value))
                setattr(node, field, old_value.__class__(new_values))

            elif isinstance(old_value, base.AST):
                new_node = self.visit(old_value)
                if new_node is not old_value:
                    if new_node is not None:
                        new_node.parent = node
                    setattr(node, field, new_node)

        return node

    def replace_child(self, child, new_child):
        if child.parent is None:
            raise base.ASTError('ast node does not have parent')

        node = child.parent
        new_child.parent = node
        child.parent = None

        for field, value in base.iter_fields(node, include_meta=False):
            if isinstance(value, list):
                for i in range(0, len(value)):
                    if value[i] == child:
                        value[i] = new_child
                        return True
