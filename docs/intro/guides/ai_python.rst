:edb-alt-title: How to set up Gel AI in Python

.. edb:split-section::

    |Gel| AI brings vector search capabilities and retrieval-augmented
    generation directly into the database. It's integrated into the |Gel|
    Python binding via the ``gel.ai`` module.

    .. code-block:: bash

      $ pip install 'gel[ai]'


Enable and configure the extension
==================================

.. edb:split-section::

    AI is an |Gel| extension. To enable it, we will need to add the extension
    to the appâ€™s schema:

    .. code-block:: sdl

        using extension ai;


.. edb:split-section::

    |Gel| AI uses external APIs in order to get vectors and LLM completions.
    For it to work, we need to configure an API provider and specify their API
    key. Let's open EdgeQL REPL and run the following query:

    .. code-block:: edgeql

        configure current database
        insert ext::ai::OpenAIProviderConfig {
          secret := 'sk-....',
        };


Now our |Gel| application can take advantage of OpenAI's API to implement AI
capabilities.


.. note::

   |Gel| AI comes with its own :ref:`UI <ref_ai_extai_reference_ui>` that can
   be used to configure providers, set up prompts and test them in a sandbox.


.. note::

   Most API providers require you to set up and account and charge money for
   model use.


Add vectors
===========

.. edb:split-section::

    Before we start introducing AI capabilities, let's set up our database with a
    schema and populate it with some data (we're going to be helping Komi-san keep
    track of her friends).

    .. code-block:: sdl

        module default {
            type Friend {
                required name: str {
                    constraint exclusive;
                };

                summary: str;               # A brief description of personality and role
                relationship_to_komi: str;  # Relationship with Komi
                defining_trait: str;        # Primary character trait or quirk
            }
        }

.. edb:split-section::

    Here's a shell command you can paste and run that will populate the
    database with some sample data.

    .. code-block:: bash
        :class: collapsible

        $ cat << 'EOF' > populate_db.edgeql
        insert Friend {
            name := 'Tadano Hitohito',
            summary := 'An extremely average high school boy with a remarkable ability to read the atmosphere and understand others\' feelings, especially Komi\'s.',
            relationship_to_komi := 'First friend and love interest',
            defining_trait := 'Perceptiveness',
        };

        insert Friend {
            name := 'Osana Najimi',
            summary := 'An extremely outgoing person who claims to have been everyone\'s childhood friend. Gender: Najimi.',
            relationship_to_komi := 'Second friend and social catalyst',
            defining_trait := 'Universal childhood friend',
        };

        insert Friend {
            name := 'Yamai Ren',
            summary := 'An intense and sometimes obsessive classmate who is completely infatuated with Komi.',
            relationship_to_komi := 'Self-proclaimed guardian and admirer',
            defining_trait := 'Obsessive devotion',
        };

        insert Friend {
            name := 'Katai Makoto',
            summary := 'A intimidating-looking but shy student who shares many communication problems with Komi.',
            relationship_to_komi := 'Fellow communication-challenged friend',
            defining_trait := 'Scary appearance but gentle nature',
        };

        insert Friend {
            name := 'Nakanaka Omoharu',
            summary := 'A self-proclaimed wielder of dark powers who acts like an anime character and is actually just a regular gaming enthusiast.',
            relationship_to_komi := 'Gaming buddy and chuunibyou friend',
            defining_trait := 'Chuunibyou tendencies',
        };
        EOF
        $ gel query -f populate_db.edgeql


.. edb:split-section::

    In order to get |Gel| to produce embedding vectors, we need to create a
    special ``deferred index`` on the type we would like to perform similarity
    search on. More specifically, we need to specify an EdgeQL expression that
    produces a string that we're going to create an embedding vector for. This
    is how we would set up an index if we wanted to perform similarity search
    on ``Friend.summary``:

    .. code-block:: sdl-diff

          module default {
              type Friend {
                  required name: str {
                      constraint exclusive;
                  };

                  summary: str;               # A brief description of personality and role
                  relationship_to_komi: str;  # Relationship with Komi
                  defining_trait: str;        # Primary character trait or quirk

        +         deferred index ext::ai::index(embedding_model := 'text-embedding-3-small')
        +             on (.summary);
              }
          }


.. edb:split-section::

    But actually, in our case it would be better if we could similarity search
    across all properties at the same time. We can define the index on a more
    complex expression - like a concatenation of string properties - like this:


    .. code-block:: sdl-diff

          module default {
              type Friend {
                  required name: str {
                      constraint exclusive;
                  };

                  summary: str;               # A brief description of personality and role
                  relationship_to_komi: str;  # Relationship with Komi
                  defining_trait: str;        # Primary character trait or quirk

                  deferred index ext::ai::index(embedding_model := 'text-embedding-3-small')
        -             on (.summary);
        +             on (
        +                 .name ++ ' ' ++ .summary ++ ' '
        +                 ++ .relationship_to_komi ++ ' '
        +                 ++ .defining_trait
        +             );
              }
          }


.. edb:split-section::

    Once we're done with schema modification, we need to apply them by going
    through a migration:

    .. code-block:: bash

        $ gel migration create
        $ gel migrate


That's it! |Gel| will make necessary API requests in the background and create an
index that will enable us to perform efficient similarity search.


Perform similarity search in Python
===================================

.. edb:split-section::

    In order to run queries against the index we just created, we need to create a
    |Gel| client and pass it to a |Gel| AI instance.

    .. code-block:: python

        import gel
        import gel.ai

        gel_client = gel.create_client()
        gel_ai = gel.ai.create_rag_client(client)

        text = "Who helps Komi make friends?"
        vector = gel_ai.generate_embeddings(
            text,
            "text-embedding-3-small",
        )

        gel_client.query(
            "select ext::ai::search(Friend, <array<float32>>$embedding_vector",
            embedding_vector=vector,
        )


.. edb:split-section::

    We are going to execute a query that calls a single function:
    ``ext::ai::search(<type>, <search_vector>)``. That function accepts an
    embedding vector as the second argument, not a text string. This means that in
    order to similarity search for a string, we need to create a vector embedding
    for it using the same model as we used to create the index. The |Gel| AI binding
    in Python comes with a ``generate_embeddings`` function that does exactly that:


    .. code-block:: python-diff

          import gel
          import gel.ai

          gel_client = gel.create_client()
          gel_ai = gel.ai.create_rag_client(client)

        + text = "Who helps Komi make friends?"
        + vector = gel_ai.generate_embeddings(
        +     text,
        +     "text-embedding-3-small",
        + )


.. edb:split-section::

    Now we can plug that vector directly into our query to get similarity search
    results:


    .. code-block:: python-diff

          import gel
          import gel.ai

          gel_client = gel.create_client()
          gel_ai = gel.ai.create_rag_client(client)

          text = "Who helps Komi make friends?"
          vector = gel_ai.generate_embeddings(
              text,
              "text-embedding-3-small",
          )

        + gel_client.query(
        +     "select ext::ai::search(Friend, <array<float32>>$embedding_vector",
        +     embedding_vector=vector,
        + )


Use the built-in RAG
====================

One more feature |Gel| AI offers is built-in retrieval-augmented generation,
also known as RAG.

.. edb:split-section::

    |Gel| comes preconfigured to be able to process our text query, perform
    similarity search across the index we just created, pass the results to an
    LLM and return a response. In order to access the built-in RAG, we need to
    start by selecting an LLM and passing its name to the |Gel| AI instance
    constructor:


    .. code-block:: python-diff

          import gel
          import gel.ai

          gel_client = gel.create_client()
          gel_ai = gel.ai.create_rag_client(
              client,
        +     model="gpt-4-turbo-preview"
          )


.. edb:split-section::

    Now we can access the RAG using the ``query_rag`` function like this:


    .. code-block:: python-diff

          import gel
          import gel.ai

          gel_client = gel.create_client()
          gel_ai = gel.ai.create_rag_client(
              client,
              model="gpt-4-turbo-preview"
          )

        + gel_ai.query_rag(
        +     "Who helps Komi make friends?",
        +     context="Friend",
        + )


.. edb:split-section::

    We can also stream the response like this:


    .. code-block:: python-diff

          import gel
          import gel.ai

          gel_client = gel.create_client()
          gel_ai = gel.ai.create_rag_client(
              client,
              model="gpt-4-turbo-preview"
          )

        - gel_ai.query_rag(
        + gel_ai.stream_rag(
              "Who helps Komi make friends?",
              context="Friend",
          )
