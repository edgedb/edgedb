.. _ref_eql_statements_start_tx:

Start transaction
=================

:eql-statement:


``start transaction`` -- start a transaction

.. eql:synopsis::

    start transaction <transaction-mode> [ , ... ] ;

    # where <transaction-mode> is one of:

    isolation { serializable | repeatable read }
    read write | read only
    deferrable | not deferrable


Description
-----------

This command starts a new transaction block.

Any EdgeDB command outside of an explicit transaction block starts
an implicit transaction block; the transaction is then automatically
committed if the command was executed successfully, or automatically
rollbacked if there was an error.  This behaviour is often called
"autocommit".


Parameters
----------

The :eql:synopsis:`<transaction-mode>` can be one of the following:

:eql:synopsis:`isolation serializable`
    All statements of the current transaction can only see data
    changes committed before the first query or data-modification
    statement was executed in this transaction.  If a pattern
    of reads and writes among concurrent serializable
    transactions would create a situation which could not have
    occurred for any serial (one-at-a-time) execution of those
    transactions, one of them will be rolled back with a
    serialization_failure error.

:eql:synopsis:`isolation repeatable read`
    All statements of the current transaction can only see data
    committed before the first query or data-modification statement
    was executed in this transaction.

    This is the default.

:eql:synopsis:`read write`
    Sets the transaction access mode to read/write.

    This is the default.

:eql:synopsis:`read only`
    Sets the transaction access mode to read-only.  Any data
    modifications with :eql:stmt:`insert`, :eql:stmt:`update`, or
    :eql:stmt:`delete` are disallowed. Schema mutations via :ref:`DDL
    <ref_eql_ddl>` are also disallowed.

:eql:synopsis:`deferrable`
    The transaction can be set to deferrable mode only when it is
    ``serializable`` and ``read only``.  When all three of these
    properties are selected for a transaction, the transaction
    may block when first acquiring its snapshot, after which it is
    able to run without the normal overhead of a ``serializable``
    transaction and without any risk of contributing to or being
    canceled by a serialization failure. This mode is well suited
    for long-running reports or backups.


Examples
--------

Start a new transaction and rollback it:

.. code-block:: edgeql

    start transaction;
    select 'Hello World!';
    rollback;

Start a serializable deferrable transaction:

.. code-block:: edgeql

    start transaction isolation serializable, read only, deferrable;
