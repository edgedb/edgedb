:edb-alt-title: Schema Definition Language


This section describes the high-level language used to define EdgeDB
schema.  It is called the EdgeDB *schema definition language* or
*SDL*.  There's a correspondence between this declarative high-level
language and the imperative low-level :ref:`DDL <ref_eql_ddl>`.

SDL is a declarative language optimized for human readability and
expressing the state of the EdgeDB schema without getting into the
details of how to arrive at that state.  Each *SDL* block represents
the complete schema state for a given :ref:`database
<ref_datamodel_databases>`.

Syntactically, an SDL declaration mirrors the ``create`` DDL for the
corresponding entity, but with all of the ``create`` and ``set``
keywords omitted.  The typical SDL structure is to use :ref:`module
blocks <ref_eql_sdl_modules>` with the rest of the declarations being
nested in their respective modules.

Since SDL is declarative in nature, the specific order of
declarations of module blocks or individual items does not matter.

The built-in :ref:`migration tools<ref_cli_edgedb_migration>` expect
the schema to be given in SDL format. For example:

.. code-block:: sdl

    # "default" module block
    module default {
        type Movie {
            required property title -> str;
            # the year of release
            property year -> int64;
            required link director -> Person;
            required multi link actors -> Person;
        }
        type Person {
            required property first_name -> str;
            required property last_name -> str;
        }
    }

It is possible to also omit the module blocks, but then individual
declarations must use :ref:`fully-qualified names
<ref_name_resolution>` so that they can be assigned
to their respective modules. For example, the following is equivalent
to the previous migration:

.. code-block:: sdl

    # no module block
    type default::Movie {
        required property title -> str;
        # the year of release
        property year -> int64;
        required link director -> default::Person;
        required multi link actors -> default::Person;
    }
    type default::Person {
        required property first_name -> str;
        required property last_name -> str;
    }
