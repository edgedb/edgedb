The CLI and client libraries (collectively referred to as "clients" below) must
connect to an EdgeDB instance to run queries or commands. There are several
connection parameters, each of which can be specified in several ways.

.. _ref_reference_connection_instance:

Specifying an instance
----------------------

There are several ways to uniquely identify an EdgeDB instance.

.. list-table::

  * - **Parameter**
    - **CLI flag**
    - **Environment variable**
  * - Instance name
    - ``--instance/-I <name>``
    - ``EDGEDB_INSTANCE``
  * - DSN
    - ``--dsn <dsn>``
    - ``EDGEDB_DSN``
  * - Host and port
    - .. code-block::

        --host/-H <host>
        --port/-P <port>
    - ``EDGEDB_HOST`` and ``EDGEDB_PORT``
  * - Credentials file
    - ``--credentials-file <path>``
    - ``EDGEDB_CREDENTIALS_FILE``
  * - *Project linking*
    - *N/A*
    - *N/A*


Let's dig into each of these a bit more.

.. _ref_reference_connection_instance_name:

**Instance name**
  All local instances (instances created on your local machine using the CLI)
  are associated with a name. This name is that's needed to connect; under the
  hood, the CLI stores the instance credentials (username, password, etc) on
  your file system in the EdgeDB :ref:`config directory
  <ref_cli_edgedb_paths>`. The CLI and client libraries look up these
  credentials to connect.

  You can also assign names to remote instances using :ref:`edgedb instance
  link <ref_cli_edgedb_instance_link>`. The CLI will save the credentials
  locally, so you can connect to a remote instance using just its name, just
  like a local instance.

**DSN**
  DSNs (data source names, also referred to as "connection strings") are a
  convenient and flexible way to specify connection information with a simple
  string. It takes the following form:

  .. code-block::

    edgedb://USERNAME:PASSWORD@HOSTNAME:PORT/DATABASE

    # example
    edgedb://alice:pa$$w0rd@example.com:1234/my_db

  All components of the DSN are optional; technically ``edgedb://`` is a valid
  DSN. The unspecified values will fall back to their defaults:

  .. code-block::

    Host: "localhost"
    Port: 5656
    User: "edgedb"
    Password: null
    Database name: "edgedb"

  DSNs also accept query parameters to support advanced use cases. Read the
  :ref:`DSN Specification <ref_dsn>` reference for details.

**Host and port**
  In general, we recommend using a fully-qualified DSN when connecting to the
  database. For convenience, it's possible to individually specify a
  host and/or a port.

  When not otherwise specified, the host defaults to ``"localhost"`` and the
  port defaults to ``5656``.

**Credentials file**
  e.g. ``/path/to/credentials.json``.

  If you wish, you can store your credentials as a JSON file. Checking this
  file into version control could present a security risk and is not
  recommended.

  .. code-block:: json

    {
      "host": "localhost",
      "port": 10702,
      "user": "testuser",
      "password": "testpassword",
      "database": "edgedb",
      "tls_cert_data": "-----BEGIN CERTIFICATE-----\nabcdef..."
    }

  Relative paths are resolved relative to the current working directory.

**Project-linked instances**
  When you run ``edgedb project init`` in a given directory, EdgeDB creates an
  instance and "links" it to that directory. There's nothing magical about this
  link; it's just a bit of metadata that gets stored in the EdgeDB config
  directory. When you use the client libraries or run a CLI command inside a
  project-linked directory, the library/CLI can detect this, look up the linked
  instance's credentials, and connect automatically.

  For more information on how this works, check out the `release post
  </blog/introducing-edgedb-projects>`_ for ``edgedb project``.

.. _ref_reference_connection_priority:

Priority levels
---------------

The section above describes the various ways of specifying an EdgeDB instance.
There are also several ways to provide this configuration information to the
client. From highest to lowest priority, you can pass them explicitly as
parameters/flags (useful for debugging), use environment variables (recommended
for production), or rely on ``edgedb project`` (recommended for development).

1. **Explicit connection parameters**. For security reasons,
   hard-coding connection information or credentials in your codebase is not
   recommended, though it may be useful for debugging or testing purposes. As
   such, explicitly provided parameters are given the highest priority.

   In the context of the client libraries, this means passing an option
   explicitly into the ``connect`` call. Here's how this looks using the
   JavaScript library:

   .. code-block:: javascript

      import * as edgedb from "edgedb";

      const pool = await edgedb.connect({
        instance: "my_instance"
      });

   In the context of the CLI, this means using the appropriate command-line
   flags:

   .. code-block:: bash

      $ edgedb --instance my_instance
      EdgeDB 1.x
      Type \help for help, \quit to quit.
      edgedb>


2. **Environment variables**.

   This is the recommended mechanism for providing connection information to
   your EdgeDB client, especially in production or when running EdgeDB inside a
   container. All clients read the following variables from the environment:

   - ``EDGEDB_DSN``
   - ``EDGEDB_INSTANCE``
   - ``EDGEDB_CREDENTIALS_FILE``
   - ``EDGEDB_HOST`` / ``EDGEDB_PORT``

   When one of these environment variables is defined, there's no need to pass
   any additional information to the client. The CLI and client libraries will
   be able to connect without any additional information. You can execute CLI
   commands without any additional flags, like so:

   .. code-block:: bash

      $ edgedb # no flags needed
      EdgeDB 1.x
      Type \help for help, \quit to quit.
      edgedb>

   Using the JavaScript client library:

   .. code-block:: javascript

      import * as edgedb from "edgedb";

      const pool = edgedb.connect();
      pool.query(`select 2 + 2;`).then(result => {
        // do stuff
      })

   .. warning::

      Ambiguity is not permitted. For instance, specifying both
      ``EDGEDB_INSTANCE`` and ``EDGEDB_DSN`` will result in an error. You *can*
      use ``EDGEDB_HOST`` and ``EDGEDB_PORT`` simultaneously.


3. **Project-linked credentials**

   If you are using ``edgedb project`` (which we recommend!) and haven't
   otherwise specified any connection parameters, the CLI and client libraries
   will connect to the instance that's been linked to your project.

   This makes it easy to get up and running with EdgeDB. Once you've run
   ``edgedb project init``, the CLI and client libraries will be able to
   connect to your database without any explicit flags or parameters, as long
   as you're inside the project directory.


If no connection information can be detected using the above mechanisms, the
connection fails.

.. warning::

   Within a given priority level, you cannot specify multiple instances
   "instance selection parameters" simultaneously. For instance, specifying
   both ``EDGEDB_INSTANCE`` and ``EDGEDB_DSN`` environment variables will
   result in an error.


.. _ref_reference_connection_granular:

Granular parameters
-------------------

The :ref:`instance selection <ref_reference_connection_instance>` section
describes several mechanisms for providing a complete set of connection
information in a single package. Occasionally—perhaps in development or for
testing—it may be useful to override a particular *component* of this
configuration.

The following "granular" parameters will override any value set by the
instance-level configuration object.

.. list-table::

  * - **Environment variable**
    - **CLI flag**
  * - ``EDGEDB_DATABASE``
    - ``--database/-d <name>``
  * - ``EDGEDB_USER``
    - ``--user/-u <user>``
  * - ``EDGEDB_PASSWORD``
    - ``--password <pass>``
  * - ``EDGEDB_TLS_CA_FILE``
    - ``--tls-ca-file <path>``
  * - ``EDGEDB_CLIENT_TLS_SECURITY``
    - ``--tls-security``
  * - ``EDGEDB_CLIENT_SECURITY``
    - N/A

**EDGEDB_DATABASE**
  Each EdgeDB *instance* can contain multiple *databases*. When in instance is
  created, a default database named ``edgedb`` is created. Unless otherwise
  specified, all incoming connections connect to the ``edgedb`` database.

**EDGEDB_USER/EDGEDB_PASSWORD**
  These are the credentials of the database user account to connect to the
  EdgeDB instance.

**EDGEDB_TLS_CA_FILE**
  TLS is required to connect to any EdgeDB instance. To do so, the client needs
  a reference to the root certificate of your instance's certificate chain.
  Typically this will be handled for you when you create a local instance or
  ``link`` a remote one.

  If you're using a globally trusted CA like Let's Encrypt, the root
  certificate will almost certainly exist already in your system's global
  certificate pool. In this case, you won't need to specify this path; it will
  be discovered automatically by the client.

  If you're self-issuing certificates, you must download the root certificate
  and provide a path to its location on the filesystem. Otherwise TLS will fail
  to connect.

**EDGEDB_CLIENT_TLS_SECURITY**
  Sets the TLS security mode. Determines whether certificate and hostname
  verification is enabled. Possible values:

  - ``"strict"`` (**default**) — certificates and hostnames will be verified
  - ``"no_host_verification"`` — verify certificates but not hostnames
  - ``"insecure"`` — client libraries will trust self-signed TLS certificates.
    useful for self-signed or custom certificates.

  This setting defaults to ``"strict"`` unless a custom certificate is
  supplied, in which case it is set to ``"no_host_verification"``.

**EDGEDB_CLIENT_SECURITY**
  Provides some simple "security presets".

  Currently there is only one valid value: ``insecure_dev_mode``. Setting
  ``EDGEDB_CLIENT_SECURITY=insecure_dev_mode`` disables all TLS security
  measures. Currently it is equivalent to setting
  ``EDGEDB_CLIENT_TLS_SECURITY=insecure`` but it may encompass additional
  configuration settings later.  This is most commonly used when developing
  locally with Docker.


.. _ref_reference_connection_granular_override:

Override behavior
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

When specified, the connection parameters (user, password, and database) will
*override* the corresponding element of a DSN, credentials file, etc. For
instance, consider the following environment variables:

.. code-block::

  EDGEDB_DSN=edgedb://olduser:oldpass@hostname.com:5656
  EDGEDB_USER=newuser
  EDGEDB_PASSWORD=newpass

In this scenario, ``newuser`` will override ``olduser`` and ``newpass``
will override ``oldpass``. The client library will try to connect using this
modified DSN: ``edgedb://newuser:newpass@hostname.com:5656``.

Overriding across priority levels
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

This override behavior only happens *same or lower priority level*. For
instance:

- ``EDGEDB_PASSWORD`` **will** override the password specified in
  ``EDGEDB_DSN``
- ``EDGEDB_PASSWORD`` **will be ignored** if a DSN is passed explicitly using
  the ``--dsn`` flag. Explicit parameters take precedence over environment
  variables. To override the password of an explicit DSN, you need to pass it
  explicitly as well:

  .. code-block:: bash

     $ edgedb --dsn edgedb://username:oldpass@hostname.com --password qwerty
     # connects to edgedb://username:qwerty@hostname.com

- ``EDGEDB_PASSWORD`` **will** override the stored password associated with a
  project-linked instance. (This is unlikely to be desirable.)
