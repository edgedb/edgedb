.. _ref_reference_edgedb_toml:

===========
edgedb.toml
===========

The ``edgedb.toml`` file is created in the project root after running
:ref:`ref_cli_edgedb_project_init`. If this file is present in a directory, it
signals to the CLI and client bindings that the directory is an instance-linked
EdgeDB project. It supports two configuration settings across two tables:

.. note::

    If you're not familiar with the TOML file format, it's a very cool, minimal
    language for config files designed to be simpler than JSON or YAML. Check
    out `the TOML documentation <https://toml.io/en/v1.0.0>`_.


``[edgedb]`` table
==================

- ``server-version``- The server version of the EdgeDB project.

  .. note::

      The version specification is assumed to be **a minimum version**, but the
      CLI will *not* upgrade to subsequent major versions. This means if the
      version specified is ``3.1`` and versions 3.2 and 3.3 are available, 3.3
      will be installed, even if version 4.0 is also available.

      To specify an exact version, prepend with ``=`` like this: ``=3.1``. We
      support `all of the same version specifications as Cargo`_,
      Rust's package manager.


``[project]`` table
===================

- ``schema-directory``- The directory where schema files will be stored.
  Defaults to ``dbschema``.


Example

.. code-block:: toml

    [edgedb]
    server-version = "3.1"

    [project]
    schema-dir = "db/schema"
