==================
Date/Time Handling
==================

EdgeDB has 6 types related to date and time handling:

* :eql:type:`datetime` (:ref:`binary format <ref_protocol_fmt_datetime>`)
* :eql:type:`duration` (:ref:`binary format <ref_protocol_fmt_duration>`)
* :eql:type:`cal::local_datetime`
  (:ref:`binary format <ref_protocol_fmt_local_datetime>`)
* :eql:type:`cal::local_date`
  (:ref:`binary format <ref_protocol_fmt_local_date>`)
* :eql:type:`cal::relative_duration`
  (:ref:`binary format <ref_protocol_fmt_relative_duration>`)
* :eql:type:`cal::date_duration`
  (:ref:`binary format <ref_protocol_fmt_date_duration>`)

Usually we try to map those types to the respective language-native types,
with the following caveats:

* The type in standard library
* It has enough range (EdgeDB has timestamps from year 1 to 9999)
* And it has good enough precision (at least microseconds)

If any of the above criteria is not met, we usually provide a custom type in
the client library itself that can be converted to a type from the language's
standard library or from a popular third-party library. Exception: The
JavaScript ``Date`` type (which is actually a timestamp) has millisecond
precision. We decided it would be better to use that type by default even
though it doesn't have sufficient precision.


Precision
=========

:eql:type:`datetime`, :eql:type:`duration`, :eql:type:`cal::local_datetime` and
:eql:type:`cal::relative_duration` all have precision of **1 millisecond**.

This means that if language-native type have a bigger precision such as
nanosecond, client library has to round that timestamp when encoding it for
EdgeDB.

We use **rouding to the nearest even** for that operation. Here are some
examples of timetamps with high precision, and how they are stored in the
database::

    2022-02-24T05:43:03.123456789Z → 2022-02-24T05:43:03.123457Z

    2022-02-24T05:43:03.000002345Z → 2022-02-24T05:43:03.000002Z
    2022-02-24T05:43:03.000002500Z → 2022-02-24T05:43:03.000002Z
    2022-02-24T05:43:03.000002501Z → 2022-02-24T05:43:03.000003Z
    2022-02-24T05:43:03.000002499Z → 2022-02-24T05:43:03.000002Z

    2022-02-24T05:43:03.000001234Z → 2022-02-24T05:43:03.000001Z
    2022-02-24T05:43:03.000001500Z → 2022-02-24T05:43:03.000002Z
    2022-02-24T05:43:03.000001501Z → 2022-02-24T05:43:03.000002Z
    2022-02-24T05:43:03.000001499Z → 2022-02-24T05:43:03.000001Z

.. note::

   A quick refresher on rounding types: If we perform multiple operations of
   summing while rounding half-up or rounding half-down, the error margin of
   the resulting value tends to increase. If we round half-to-even instead,
   the expected value of summing tends to be more accurate.

Note as described in :ref:`datetime protocol documentation
<ref_protocol_fmt_datetime>` the value is encoded as a *signed* microseconds
delta since a fixed time. Some care must be taken when rounding negative
microsecond values. See `tests for Rust implementation`_ for a good set of
test cases.

Rounding to the nearest even applies to all operations that client libraries
perform, in particular:

1. Encoding timestamps *and* time deltas (see the :ref:`list of types
   <ref_bindings_datetime>`) to the binary format if precision of the native
   type is higher than microseconds.
2. Decoding timestamps *and* time deltas from the binary format is precision
   of native type is lower than microseconds (applies for JavaScript for
   example)
3. Converting from EdgeDB specific type (if there is one) to native type and
   back (depending on the difference in precision)
4. Parsing a string to an EdgeDB specific type (this operation is optional to
   implement, but if it is implemented, it must obey the rules)
