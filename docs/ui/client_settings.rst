    :alt: The EdgeDB client settings dropdown bar showing a user changing
          a client setting called implicit limit from 50 to 100. Two other
          client settings that can be modified are displayed: allow bare
          ddl, and allow user specified I D.

The UI exposes a number of :ref:`configuration parameters <ref_std_cfg>`
in a dropdown bar at the top of all database dashboard screens. Clicking
on the Client Settings button will show the bar, after which a double
click allows you to modify them.

The parameters are as follows:

Globals
-------

- Nothing by default. Any globals defined in your schema will show up and
  can be set here.

Config
------

- ``allow_bare_ddl``: Whether DDL may be used outside the normal migration
  flow. Default: ``NeverAllow``, can be set to ``AlwaysAllow``.
  Note: This parameter accepts enum values, not booleans.
- ``allow_user_specified_id``: Whether users are allowed to manually set the
  'id' property. Default: ``false``.
- ``apply_access_policies``: Whether
  :ref:`access policies <ref_datamodel_access_policies>` will be applied
  when running queries. Default: ``true``. When set to ``false``, access
  policies will no longer restrict any operations they would naturally
  restrict.
- ``force_database_error``: A hook to force all queries to produce an error.
  Default: ``'false'`` (note: a string ``'false'``, not a boolean). This 
  parameter takes a ``str`` instead of a ``bool`` to allow more verbose
  messages. The database will attempt to deserialize this ``str`` into a 
  JSON object that must include a ``type`` (which must be an EdgeDB error
  type name), and may also include ``message``, ``hint``, and ``details`` 
  which can be set ad-hoc by the user. For example, the following is
  valid input: ``'{ "type": "QueryError", "message": "Did not
  work", "hint": "Try doing something else", "details": "Indeed, something
  went really wrong" }'``
- ``query_execution_timeout``: How long an individual query can run before
  being aborted. Disabled when set to zero seconds (``<datetime>'PT0S'``),
  which is the default.
- ``session_idle_transaction_timeout``: How long client connections can
  stay active while in a transaction. Disabled when set to zero seconds
  (``<datetime>'PT0S'``). Default: 10 seconds.

Query Options
-------------

- Implicit Limit (``int64``): The maximum number of results to display 
  per query. Default: 100.
