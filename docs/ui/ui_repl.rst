:edb-alt-title: UI REPL

.. image:: images/ui_repl.png
    :alt: The REPL page in the EdgeDB UI. The icon is a blue right-facing
          angle bracket followed by an orange underscore, representing a
          cursor awaiting user input. The output for a query on a
          user-defined type called Person is displayed.
    :width: 100%

The REPL available in the EdgeDB UI is largely the same as the CLI REPL,
so most of the :ref:`CLI REPL commands <ref_cheatsheet_repl>` will pertain to
the UI REPL as well.

Some behavior differs from that of the CLI REPL:

- The UI REPL currently does not support transactions,
- Slash commands may differ slightly inside the CLI REPL. See the 
  `source code <slash_command_>`_ for more details (note: the UI REPL
  has its own ``\retro`` slash command to change the UI layout to a 1980s
  classic green-on-black feel!)
