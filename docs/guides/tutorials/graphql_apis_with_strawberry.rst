:edb-alt-title: Building a GraphQL API with EdgeDB and Strawberry

EdgeDB allows you to query your database with GraphQL via the built-in GraphQL
extension. It enables you to expose GraphQL-driven CRUD APIs for all object
types, their properties, links, and aliases. This opens up the scope for
creating backendless applications where the users will directly communicate
with the database. You can learn more about that in the
`GraphQL <https://www.edgedb.com/docs/graphql/index>`_ section of the docs.

However, as of now, EdgeDB is not ready to be used as a standalone backend. You
shouldn't expose your EdgeDB instance directly to the application’s frontend;
this is insecure and will give all users full read/write access to your
database. So, in this tutorial, we'll see how you can quickly create a simple
GraphQL API without using the built-in extension and give the users restricted
access to the database schema. Also, we'll implement HTTP basic authentication
and demonstrate how you can write your own GraphQL validators and resolvers.
This tutorial assumes you're already familiar with GraphQL terms like
schema, query, mutation, resolver, validator, etc, and have used GraphQL with
some other technology before.

We'll build the same movie organization system that we used in the Flask
`tutorial <https://www.edgedb.com/docs/guides/tutorials/rest_apis_with_flask>`_
and expose the objects and relationships as a GraphQL API. Using the GraphQL
interface, you'll be able to fetch, create, update, and delete movie and actor
objects in the database. `Strawberry <https://strawberry.rocks/>`_ is a Python
library that takes a code-first approach where you'll write your object schema
as Python classes. This allows us to focus more on how you can integrate EdgeDB
into your workflow than the idiosyncrasies of GraphQL itself. We'll also use
the EdgeDB client to communicate with the database,
`FastAPI <https://fastapi.tiangolo.com/>`_ to build the authentication layer,
and Uvicorn as the webserver.

Prerequisites
=============

Before we start, make sure you have :ref:`installed <ref_admin_install>` the
``edgedb`` command-line tool. Here, we'll use Python 3.10 and a few of its
latest features while building the APIs. A working version of this tutorial can
be found `on Github
<https://github.com/edgedb/edgedb-examples/tree/main/strawberry-gql>`_.


Install the dependencies
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

To follow along, clone the repository and head over to the ``strawberry-gql``
directory.


.. code-block:: bash

    $ git clone git@github.com:edgedb/edgedb-examples.git
    $ cd edgedb-examples/strawberry-gql

Create a Python 3.10 virtual environment, activate it, and install the
dependencies with this command:

.. code-block:: bash

    $ python3.10 -m venv .venv
    $ source .venv/bin/activate
    $ pip install edgedb fastapi strawberry-graphql uvicorn[standard]


Initialize the database
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Now, let's initialize an EdgeDB project. From the project's root directory:

.. code-block:: bash

    $ edgedb project init
    Initializing project...

    Specify the name of EdgeDB instance to use with this project
    [default: strawberry_crud]:
    > strawberry_crud

    Do you want to start instance automatically on login? [y/n]
    > y
    Checking EdgeDB versions...

Once you've answered the prompts, a new EdgeDB instance called
``strawberry_crud`` will be created and started.


Connect to the database
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Let's test that we can connect to the newly started instance. To do so, run:

.. code-block:: bash

    $ edgedb

You should be connected to the database instance and able to see a prompt
similar to this:

::

    EdgeDB 1.x (repl 1.x)
    Type \help for help, \quit to quit.
    edgedb>

You can start writing queries here. However, the database is currently
empty. Let's start designing the data model.

Schema design
=============

The movie organization system will have two object types—**movies** and
**actors**. Each *movie* can have links to multiple *actors*. The goal is to
create a GraphQL API suite that'll allow us to fetch, create, update, and
delete the objects while maintaining their relationships.

EdgeDB allows us to declaratively define the structure of the objects. The
schema lives inside ``.esdl`` file in the ``dbschema`` directory. It's
common to declare the entire schema in a single file ``dbschema/default.esdl``.
This is how our datatypes look:

.. code-block:: sdl

    # dbschema/default.esdl

    module default {
      abstract type Auditable {
        property created_at -> datetime {
          readonly := true;
          default := datetime_current();
        }
      }

      type Actor extending Auditable {
        required property name -> str {
          constraint max_len_value(50);
        }
        property age -> int16 {
          constraint min_value(0);
          constraint max_value(100);
        }
        property height -> int16 {
          constraint min_value(0);
          constraint max_value(300);
        }
      }

      type Movie extending Auditable {
        required property name -> str {
          constraint max_len_value(50);
        }
        property year -> int16{
          constraint min_value(1850);
        };
        multi link actors -> Actor;
      }
    }


Here, we've defined an ``abstract`` type called ``Auditable`` to take advantage
of EdgeDB's schema mixin system. This allows us to add a ``created_at``
property to multiple types without repeating ourselves.

The ``Actor`` type extends ``Auditable`` and inherits the ``created_at``
property as a result. This property is auto-filled via the ``datetime_current``
function. Along with the inherited type, the actor type also defines a few
additional properties like called ``name``, ``age``, and ``height``. The
constraints on the properties make sure that actor names can't be longer than
50 characters, age must be between 0 to 100 years, and finally, height must be
between 0 to 300 centimeters.

We also define a ``Movie`` type that extends the ``Auditable`` abstract type.
It also contains some additional concrete properties and links: ``name``,
``year``, and an optional multi-link called ``actors`` which refers to the
``Actor`` objects.


Build the GraphQL API
=====================

The API endpoints are defined in the ``app`` directory. The directory structure
looks as follows:

::

    app
    ├── __init__.py
    ├── main.py
    └── schemas.py

The ``schemas.py`` module contains the code that defines the GraphQL schema and
builds the queries and mutations for ``Actor`` and ``Movie`` objects. The
``main.py`` module then registers the GraphQL schema, adds the authentication
layer, and exposes the API to the webserver.


Write the GraphQL schema
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Along with the database schema, to expose EdgeDB's object relational model as a
GraphQL API, you'll also have to define a GraphQL schema that mirrors the
object structure in the database. Strawberry allows us to express this schema
via type annotated Python classes. We define the Strawberry schema in the
``schema.py`` file as follows:

.. code-block:: python

    # strawberry-gql/app/schema.py
    from __future__ import annotations

    import json # will be used later for serialization

    import edgedb
    import strawberry

    client = edgedb.create_async_client()


    @strawberry.type
    class Actor:
        name: str | None
        age: int | None = None
        height: int | None = None


    @strawberry.type
    class Movie:
        name: str | None
        year: int | None = None
        actors: list[Actor] | None = None

Here, the GraphQL schema mimics our database schema. Similar to the ``Actor``
and ``Movie`` types in the EdgeDB schema, here, both the ``Actor`` and
``Movie`` models have three attributes. Likewise, the ``actors`` attribute in
the ``Movie`` model represents the link between movies and actors.


Query actors
^^^^^^^^^^^^

In this section, we'll write the resolver to create the queries that'll
allow us to fetch the actor objects from the database. You'll need to write the
query resolvers as methods in a class decorated with the ``@strawberry.type``
decorator. Each method will also need to be decorated with the
``@strawberry.field`` decorator to mark them as resolvers. Resolvers can be
either sync or async. In this particular case, we'll write asynchronous
resolvers that'll act in a non-blocking manner. The query to fetch the actors
is built in the ``schema.py`` file as follows:

.. code-block:: python

    # strawberry-gql/app/schema.py
    ...

    @strawberry.type
    class Query:
        @strawberry.field
        async def get_actors(
            self, filter_name: str | None = None
        ) -> list[Actor]:

            if filter_name:
                actors_json = await client.query_json(
                    """
                    select Actor {name, age, height}
                    filter .name=<str>$filter_name
                """,
                    filter_name=filter_name,
                )
            else:
                actors_json = await client.query_json(
                    """
                    select Actor {name, age, height}
                """
                )
            actors = json.loads(actors_json)
            return [
                Actor(name, age, height)
                for (name, age, height) in (
                    d.values() for d in actors
                )
            ]

    # Register the Query.
    schema = strawberry.Schema(query=Query)

Here, the ``get_actors`` resolver method accepts an optional ``filter_name``
parameter and returns a list of ``Actor`` type objects. The optional
``filter_name`` parameter allows us to build the capability of filtering the
actor objects by name. Inside the method, we use the EdgeDB client to
asynchronously query the data. The ``client.query_json`` method returns JSON
serialized data which we use to create the ``Actor`` instances. Finally, we
return the list of actor instances and the rest of the work is done by
Strawberry. Then in the last line of the above snippet, we register the
``Query`` class to build the ``Schema`` instance.

Afterward, in the ``main.py`` module, we use FastAPI to expose the ``/graphql``
endpoint. Also, we add a basic HTTP authentication layer to demonstrate how you
can easily protect your GraphQL endpoint by leveraging FastAPI's dependency
injection system. Here's how the content of the ``main.py`` looks:

.. code-block:: python

    # strawberry-gql/app/main.py
    from __future__ import annotations

    import secrets
    from typing import Literal

    from fastapi import (
        Depends, FastAPI, HTTPException, Request,
        Response, status
    )
    from fastapi.security import HTTPBasic, HTTPBasicCredentials
    from strawberry.fastapi import GraphQLRouter

    from app.schema import schema

    app = FastAPI()
    router = GraphQLRouter(schema)
    security = HTTPBasic()


    def auth(
        credentials: HTTPBasicCredentials = Depends(security)
    ) -> Literal[True]:

        """Simple HTTP Basic Auth."""

        correct_username = secrets.compare_digest(
            credentials.username, "ubuntu"
        )
        correct_password = secrets.compare_digest(
            credentials.password, "debian"
        )

        if not (correct_username and correct_password):
            raise HTTPException(
                status_code=status.HTTP_401_UNAUTHORIZED,
                detail="Incorrect email or password",
                headers={"WWW-Authenticate": "Basic"},
            )
        return True


    @router.api_route("/", methods=["GET", "POST"])
    async def graphql(request: Request) -> Response:
        return await router.handle_graphql(request=request)

    app.include_router(
        router, prefix="/graphql", dependencies=[Depends(auth)]
    )

First, we initialize the ``FastAPI`` app instance which will communicate with
the Uvicorn webserver. Then we attach the initialized ``schema`` instance to
the ``GraphQLRouter``. The ``HTTPBasic`` class provides the machinery required
to add the authentication layer. The ``auth`` function houses the
implementation details of how we're comparing the incoming and expected
username and passwords as well as how the webserver is going to handle
unauthorized requests. The ``graphql`` handler function is the one that handles
the incoming HTTP requests. Finally, the router instance and the security
handler are registered to the app instance via the ``app.include_router``
method.

We can now start querying the ``/graphql`` endpoint. We'll use the built-in
GraphiQL interface to perform the queries. Before that, let's start the Uvicorn
webserver first. Run:

.. code-block:: bash

    $ uvicorn app.main:app --port 5000 --reload

This exposes the webserver in port 5000. Now, in your browser, go to
`http://localhost:5000/graphql <http://localhost:5000/graphql>`_. Here, you'll
find that the HTTP basic auth requires us to provide the username and password.

.. image::
    https://www.edgedb.com/docs/tutorials/strawberry/http_basic.png
    :alt: HTTP basic auth prompt
    :width: 100%


Currently, the allowed username and password is ``ubuntu`` and ``debian``
respectively. Provide the credentials and you'll be taken to a page that looks
like this:


.. image::
    https://www.edgedb.com/docs/tutorials/strawberry/graphiql.png
    :alt: GraphiQL interface
    :width: 100%

You can write your GraphQL queries here. Let's write a query that'll fetch all
the actors in the database and show all three of their attributes. The
following query does that:

.. code-block:: graphql

    query ActorQuery {
      getActors {
        age
        height
        name
      }
    }

The following response will appear on the right panel of the GraphiQL explorer:

.. image::
    https://www.edgedb.com/docs/tutorials/strawberry/query_actors.png
    :alt: Query actors
    :width: 100%

Since as of now, the database doesn't have any data, the payload is returning
an empty list. Let's write a mutation and create some actors.

Mutate actors
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Mutations are also written in the ``schema.py`` file. To write a mutation,
you'll have to create a separate class where you'll write the mutation
resolvers. The resolver methods will need to be decorated with
the ``@strawberry.mutation`` decorator. You can write the mutation that'll
create an actor object in the database as follows:

.. code-block:: python

    # strawberry-gql/app/schema.py
    ...

    @strawberry.type
    class Mutation:
        @strawberry.mutation
        async def create_actor(
            self, name: str,
            age: int | None = None,
            height: int | None = None
        ) -> ResponseActor:

            actor_json = await client.query_single_json(
                """
                with new_actor := (
                    insert Actor {
                        name := <str>$name,
                        age := <optional int16>$age,
                        height := <optional int16>$height
                    }
                )
                select new_actor {name, age, height}
            """,
                name=name,
                age=age,
                height=height,
            )

            actor = json.loads(actor_json)
            return Actor(
                actor.get("name"),
                actor.get("age"),
                actor.get("height")
            )

	# Mutation class needs to be registered here.
        schema = strawberry.Schema(query=Query, mutation=Mutation)


Creating a mutation also includes data validation. By type annotating the
``Mutation`` class, we're implicitly asking Strawberry to perform data
validation on the incoming request payload. Strawberry will raise an HTTP 400
if the validation fails. Let's create an actor. Submit the following graphql
query in the GraphiQL interface:

.. code-block:: graphql

    mutation ActorMutation {
      __typename
      createActor(
          name: "Robert Downey Jr.",
          age: 57,
          height: 173
      ) {
          age
          height
          name
       }
    }

In the above mutation, ``name`` is a required field and the remaining two are
optional fields. This mutation will create an actor named ``Robert Downey Jr.``
and show all three attributes— ``name``, ``age``, and ``height`` of the created
actor in the response payload. Here's the response:

.. image::
    https://www.edgedb.com/docs/tutorials/strawberry/create_actor.png
    :alt: Create an actor
    :width: 100%

Now that we've created an actor object, we can run the previously created query
to fetch the actors. Running the ``ActorQuery`` will give you the following
response:

.. image::
    https://www.edgedb.com/docs/tutorials/strawberry/query_actors_2.png
    :alt: Query actors
    :width: 100%

You can also filter actors by their names. To do so, you'd leverage the
``filterName`` parameter of the ``getActors`` resolver:

.. code-block:: graphql

    query ActorQuery {
      __typename
      getActors(filterName: "Robert Downey Jr.") {
        age
        height
        name
      }
    }

This will only display the filtered results. Similarly, as shown above, you can
write the mutations to update and delete actors. Their implementations can be
found in the ``schema.py`` file. Checkout ``update_actors`` and
``delete_resolvers`` to learn more about their implementation details. You can
update one or more attributes of an actor with the following mutation:

.. code-block:: graphql

    mutation ActorMutation {
      __typename
      updateActors(filterName: "Robert Downey Jr.", age: 60) {
        name
        age
        height
      }
    }

Running this mutation will update the ``age`` of ``Robert Downey Jr.``. First,
we filter the objects that we want to mutate via the ``filterName`` parameter
and then we update the relevant attributes; in this case, we updated the
``age`` of the object. Finally, we show all the fields in the return payload.
Use the GraphiQL explorer to interactively play with the full API suite.

Query movies
^^^^^^^^^^^^

In the ``schema.py`` file, the query to fetch movies is constructed as
follows:

.. code-block:: python

    # strawberry-gql/app/schema.py
    ...

    @strawberry.type
    class Query:
        ...

        @strawberry.field
        async def get_movies(
            self, filter_name: str | None = None,
        ) -> list[Movie]:

            if filter_name:
                movies_json = await client.query_json(
                    """
                    select Movie {name, year, actors: {name, age, height}}
                    filter .name=<str>$filter_name
                """,
                    filter_name=filter_name,
                )
            else:
                movies_json = await client.query_json(
                    """
                    select Movie {name, year, actors: {name, age, height}}
                """
                )

            # Deserialize.
            movies = json.loads(movies_json)
            for idx, movie in enumerate(movies):
                actors = [
                    Actor(name) for d in movie.get("actors", [])
                    for name in d.values()
                ]

                movies[idx] = Movie(
                                movie.get("name"),
                                movie.get("year"), actors
                            )
            return movies

Similar to the actor query, this also allows you to either fetch all or filter
movies by the movie names. Execute the following query to see the movies in the
database:

.. code-block:: graphql

    query MovieQuery {
      __typename
      getMovies {
        actors {
          age
          height
          name
        }
        name
        year
      }
    }

This will return an empty list since the database doesn't contain any movies.
In the next section, we'll create a mutation to create the movies and query
them afterward.

Mutate movies
^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Before running any query to fetch the movies, let's see how you'd construct
a mutation that allows you to create movies. You can build the mutation similar
to how we've constructed the create actor mutation. It looks like this:

.. code-block:: python

    # strawberry-gql/app/schema.py
    ...

    @strawberry.type
    class Mutation:
        ...

        @strawberry.mutation
        async def create_movie(
            self,
            name: str,
            year: int | None = None,
            actor_names: list[str] | None = None,
        ) -> Movie:
            movie_json = await client.query_single_json(
                """
                with
                    name := <str>$name,
                    year := <optional int16>$year,
                    actor_names := <optional array<str>>$actor_names,
                    new_movie := (
                        insert Movie {
                            name := name,
                            year := year,
                            actors := (
                                select detached Actor
                                filter .name in array_unpack(actor_names)
                            )
                        }
                    )
                select new_movie {
                    name,
                    year,
                    actors: {name, age, height}
                }
            """,
                name=name,
                year=year,
                actor_names=actor_names,
            )

            movie = json.loads(movie_json)
            actors = [
                Actor(name) for d in movie.get("actors", [])
                for name in d.values()]

            return Movie(
                movie.get("name"),
                movie.get("year"),
                actors
            )

You can submit a request to this mutation to create a movie. While creating a
movie, you must provide the name of the movie as it's a required field. Also,
you can optionally provide the ``year`` the movie was released and an array
containing the names of the casts. If the values of the ``actor_names`` field
match any existing actor in the database, the above snippet makes sure that the
movie will be linked with the corresponding actors. In the GraphiQL explorer,
run the following mutation to create a movie named ``Avengers`` and link the
actor ``Robert Downey Jr.`` with the movie:

.. code-block:: graphql

    mutation MovieMutation {
      __typename
      createMovie(
        name: "Avengers",
        actorNames: ["Robert Downey Jr."],
        year: 2012
      ) {
          actors {
            name
        }
      }
    }

It'll return:

    :alt: Create a movie
    :width: 100%


Now you can fetch the movies with a simple query like this one:

.. code-block:: graphql

    query MovieQuery {
      __typename
      getMovies {
        name
        year
        actors {
          name
        }
      }
    }

You'll then see an output similar to this:

.. image::
    https://www.edgedb.com/docs/tutorials/strawberry/query_movies.png
    :alt: Query movies
    :width: 100%

Take a look at the ``update_movies`` and ``delete_movies`` resolvers to gain
more insights into the implementation details of those mutations.


Conclusion
==========

In this tutorial, you've seen how can use Strawberry and EdgeDB together to
quickly build a fully-featured GraphQL API. Also, you have seen how FastAPI
allows you add an authentication layer and serve the API in a secure manner.
One thing to keep in mind here is, ideally, you'd only use GraphQL if you're
interfacing with something that already expects a GraphQL API. Otherwise,
EdgeQL is always going to be more powerful and expressive than GraphQL's query
syntax.
