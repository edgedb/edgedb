:edb-alt-title: Building a REST API with EdgeDB and FastAPI

EdgeDB can help you quickly build REST APIs in Python without getting into the
rigmarole of using ORM libraries to handle your data effectively. Here, we'll
be using `FastAPI <https://fastapi.tiangolo.com/>`_ to expose the API endpoints
and EdgeDB to store the content.

We'll build a simple event management system where you'll be able to fetch,
create, update, and delete *events* and *event hosts* via RESTful API
endpoints.

Prerequisites
=============

Before we start, make sure you've :ref:`installed <ref_admin_install>` the
``edgedb`` command line tool. In this tutorial, we'll use Python 3.10 and take
advantage of the asynchronous I/O paradigm to communicate with the database
more efficiently. A working version of this tutorial can be found
`on Github
<https://github.com/edgedb/edgedb-examples/tree/main/fastapi-crud>`_.


Install the dependencies
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

To follow along, clone the repository and head over to the ``fastapi-crud``
directory.


.. code-block:: bash

    $ git clone git@github.com:edgedb/edgedb-examples.git
    $ cd edgedb-examples/fastapi-crud

Create a Python 3.10 virtual environment, activate it, and install
the dependencies with this command. On Linux/macOS:

.. code-block:: bash

    $ python -m venv myvenv
    $ source myvenv/bin/activate
    $ pip install edgedb fastapi 'httpx[cli]' uvicorn


.. note::

    This commands will differ for Windows/Powershell users; `this guide
    <https://realpython.com/python-virtual-environments-a-primer/>`_ provides
    instructions for working with virtual environments across a range of OSes,
    including Windows.

Initialize the database
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Now, let's initialize an EdgeDB project. From the project's root directory:

.. code-block:: bash

    $ edgedb project init
    Initializing project...

    Specify the name of EdgeDB instance to use with this project
    [default: fastapi_crud]:
    > fastapi_crud

    Do you want to start instance automatically on login? [y/n]
    > y
    Checking EdgeDB versions...

Once you've answered the prompts, a new EdgeDB instance called ``fastapi_crud``
will be created and started.


Connect to the database
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Let's test that we can connect to the newly started instance. To do so, run:

.. code-block:: bash

    $ edgedb

You should be connected to the database instance and able to see a prompt
similar to this:

::

    EdgeDB 2.x (repl 2.x)
    Type \help for help, \quit to quit.
    edgedb>

You can start writing queries here. However, the database is currently
schemaless. Let's start designing out data model.

Schema design
=============

The event management system will have two entities—**events** and **users**.
Each *event* can have an optional link to a *user*. The goal is to create API
endpoints that'll allow us to fetch, create, update, and delete the entities
while maintaining their relationships.

EdgeDB allows us to declaratively define the structure of the entities. If
you've worked with SQLAlchemy or Django ORM, you might refer to these
declarative schema definitions as *models*. In EdgeDB we call them
"object types".

The schema lives inside ``.esdl`` files in the ``dbschema`` directory. It's
common to declare the entire schema in a single file
``dbschema/default.esdl``. This is how our datatypes look:

.. code-block:: sdl

    # dbschema/default.esdl

    module default {
      abstract type Auditable {
        property created_at -> datetime {
          readonly := true;
          default := datetime_current();
        }
      }

      type User extending Auditable {
        required property name -> str {
          constraint exclusive;
          constraint max_len_value(50);
        };
      }

      type Event extending Auditable {
        required property name -> str {
          constraint exclusive;
          constraint max_len_value(50);
        }
        property address -> str;
        property schedule -> datetime;
        link host -> User;
      }
    }

Here, we've defined an ``abstract`` type called ``Auditable`` to take advantage
of EdgeDB's schema mixin system. This allows us to add a ``created_at``
property to multiple types without repeating ourselves. Abstract types
don't have any concrete footprints in the database, as they don't hold any
actual data. Their only job is to propagate properties, links, and constraints
to the types that extend them.

The ``User`` type extends ``Auditable`` and inherits the ``created_at``
property as a result. This property is auto-filled via the
``datetime_current`` function. Along with the inherited type, the user type
also defines a concrete required property called ``name``. We impose two
constraints on this property: names should be unique and shorter than 50
characters.

We also define an ``Event`` type that extends the
``Auditable`` abstract type. It also contains some additional concrete
properties and links: ``address``, ``schedule``, and an optional link called
``host`` that corresponds to a ``User``.

Build the API endpoints
=======================

The API endpoints are defined in the ``app`` directory. The directory structure
looks as follows:

::

    app
    ├── __init__.py
    ├── events.py
    ├── main.py
    └── users.py

The ``user.py`` and ``event.py`` modules contain the code to build the ``User``
and ``Event`` APIs respectively. The ``main.py`` module then registers all the
endpoints and exposes them to the `uvicorn <https://www.uvicorn.org>`_
webserver.


User APIs
^^^^^^^^^^

Since the ``User`` type is simpler, we'll start with that. Let's
create a ``GET /users`` endpoint so that we can see the ``User``
objects saved in the database. You can create the API with a couple of lines of
code in FastAPI:

.. code-block:: python

    # fastapi-crud/app/users.py
    from __future__ import annotations

    import datetime
    from http import HTTPStatus
    from typing import Iterable

    import edgedb
    from fastapi import APIRouter, HTTPException, Query
    from pydantic import BaseModel

    router = APIRouter()
    client = edgedb.create_async_client()


    class RequestData(BaseModel):
        name: str


    class ResponseData(BaseModel):
        name: str
        created_at: datetime.datetime


    @router.get("/users")
    async def get_users(
        name: str = Query(None, max_length=50)
        ) -> Iterable[ResponseData]:

        if not name:
            users = await client.query(
                "SELECT User {name, created_at};"
                )
        else:
            users = await client.query(
            """SELECT User {name, created_at}
                FILTER User.name = <str>$name""",
                name=name,
            )
        response = (
            ResponseData(
                name=user.name,
                created_at=user.created_at
            ) for user in users
        )
        return response

The ``APIRouter`` instance does the actual work of exposing the API. We also
create an async EdgeDB client instance to communicate with the database. By
default, this API will return a list of users, but you can also filter the
objects by name.

In the ``get_users`` function, we perform asynchronous queries via the
``edgedb`` client and serialize the returned data with the ``ResponseData``
model. Then we aggregate the instances in a generator and return it. Afterward,
the JSON serialization part is taken care of by FastAPI. This endpoint is
exposed to the server in the ``main.py`` module. Here's the content of the
module:

.. code-block:: python

    # fastapi-crud/app/main.py
    from __future__ import annotations

    from fastapi import FastAPI
    from starlette.middleware.cors import CORSMiddleware

    from app import events, users

    fast_api = FastAPI()

    # Set all CORS enabled origins.
    fast_api.add_middleware(
        CORSMiddleware,
        allow_origins=["*"],
        allow_credentials=True,
        allow_methods=["*"],
        allow_headers=["*"],
    )


    fast_api.include_router(events.router)
    fast_api.include_router(users.router)


To test the endpoint, go to the ``fastapi-crud`` directory and run:

.. code-block:: bash

    $ uvicorn app.main:fast_api --port 5000 --reload

This will start a ``uvicorn`` server and you'll be able to start making
requests against it. Earlier, we installed the
`HTTPx <https://www.python-httpx.org/>`_ client library to make HTTP requests
programmatically. It also comes with a neat command-line tool that we'll use to
test our API.

While the ``uvicorn`` server is running, on a new console, run:

.. code-block:: bash

    $ httpx -m GET http://localhost:5000/users

You'll see the following output on the console:

::

    HTTP/1.1 200 OK
    date: Sat, 16 Apr 2022 22:58:11 GMT
    server: uvicorn
    content-length: 2
    content-type: application/json

    []

Our request yielded an empty list because the database is currently empty.
Let's create the ``POST /users`` endpoint to start saving users
in the database. The POST endpoint can be built similarly:

.. code-block:: python

    # fastapi-crud/app/users.py
    ...
    @router.post("/users", status_code=HTTPStatus.CREATED)
    async def post_user(user: RequestData) -> ResponseData:
        try:
            (created_user,) = await client.query(
                """
                WITH
                    new_user := (INSERT User {name := <str>$name})
                SELECT new_user {
                    name,
                    created_at
                };
                """,
                name=user.name,
            )
        except edgedb.errors.ConstraintViolationError:
            raise HTTPException(
                status_code=HTTPStatus.BAD_REQUEST,
                detail={
                "error": f"Username '{user.name}' already exists,"
                },
            )
        response = ResponseData(
            name=created_user.name,
            created_at=created_user.created_at,
        )
        return response

In the above snippet, we ingest data with the shape dictated by the
``RequestData`` model and return a payload with the shape defined in the
``ResponseData`` model. The ``try...except`` block gracefully handles the
situation where the API consumer might try to create multiple users with the
same name. A successful request will yield the status code HTTP 201 (created).
To test it out, make a request as follows:

.. code-block:: bash

    $ httpx -m POST http://localhost:5000/users \
            --json '{"name" : "Jonathan Harker"}'


The output should look similar to this:

::

    HTTP/1.1 201 Created
    ...
    {
      "name": "Jonathan Harker",
      "created_at": "2022-04-16T23:09:30.929664+00:00"
    }

If you try to make the same request again, it'll throw an HTTP 400
(bad request) error:

::

    HTTP/1.1 400 Bad Request
    ...
    {
    "detail": {
      "error": "Username 'Jonathan Harker' already exists."
      }
    }

Before we move on to the next step, create 2 more users called
``Count Dracula`` and ``Mina Murray``. Once you've done that, we can move on to
the next step of building the ``PUT /users`` endpoint to update the user data.
It can be built like this:


.. code-block:: python

    # fastapi-crud/app/users.py
    ...
    @router.put("/users")
    async def put_user(
        user: RequestData, filter_name: str
    ) -> Iterable[ResponseData]:
        try:
            updated_users = await client.query(
                """
                SELECT (
                    UPDATE User FILTER .name=<str>$filter_name
                        SET {name:=<str>$name}
                ) {name, created_at};
                """,
                name=user.name,
                filter_name=filter_name,
            )
        except edgedb.errors.ConstraintViolationError:
            raise HTTPException(
                status_code=HTTPStatus.BAD_REQUEST,
                detail={
                "error": f"Username '{filter_name}' already exists."
                },
            )
        response = (
            ResponseData(
                name=user.name, created_at=user.created_at
            ) for user in updated_users
        )
        return response

Here, we'll isolate the intended object that we want to update by filtering the
users with the ``filter_name`` parameter. For example, if you wanted to update
the properties of ``Jonathan Harker``, the value of the ``filter_name`` query
parameter would be ``Jonathan Harker``. The following command changes the name
of ``Jonathan Harker`` to ``Dr. Van Helsing``.

.. code-block:: bash

    $ httpx -m PUT http://localhost:5000/users \
            -p 'filter_name' 'Jonathan Harker' \
            --json '{"name" : "Dr. Van Helsing"}'

This will return:

::

    HTTP/1.1 200 OK
    ...
    [
      {
        "name": "Dr. Van Helsing",
        "created_at": "2022-04-16T23:09:30.929664+00:00"
      }
    ]

If you try to change the name of a user to match that of an existing user, the
endpoint will throw an HTTP 400 (bad request) error:

.. code-block:: bash

    $ httpx -m PUT http://localhost:5000/users \
            -p 'filter_name' 'Count Dracula' \
            --json '{"name" : "Dr. Van Helsing"}'

This returns:

::

    HTTP/1.1 400 Bad Request
    ...
    {
      "detail": {
        "error": "Username 'Count Dracula' already exists."
      }
    }

Another API that we'll need to cover is the ``DELETE /users`` endpoint. It'll
allow us to query the name of the targeted object and delete that. The code
looks similar to the ones you've already seen:


.. code-block:: python

    # fastapi-crud/app/users.py
    ...
    @router.delete("/users")
    async def delete_user(name: str) -> Iterable[ResponseData]:
        try:
            deleted_users = await client.query(
                """SELECT (
                    DELETE User FILTER .name = <str>$name
                ) {name, created_at};
                """,
                name=name,
            )
        except edgedb.errors.ConstraintViolationError:
            raise HTTPException(
                status_code=HTTPStatus.BAD_REQUEST,
                detail={
                    "error": "User attached to an event. "
                    "Cannot delete."
                },
            )

        response = (
            ResponseData(
                name=deleted_user.name,
                created_at=deleted_user.created_at
            ) for deleted_user in deleted_users
        )

        return response

This endpoint will simply delete the requested user if the user isn't attached
to any event. If the targeted object is attached to an event, the API will
throw an HTTP 400 (bad request) error and refuse to delete the object. To
delete ``Count Dracula``, on your console, run:

.. code-block:: bash

    $ httpx -m DELETE http://localhost:5000/users \
            -p 'name' 'Count Dracula'

That'll return:

::

    HTTP/1.1 200 OK
    ...
    [
      {
        "name": "Count Dracula",
        "created_at": "2022-04-16T23:23:56.630101+00:00"
      }
    ]

Event APIs
^^^^^^^^^^

The event APIs are built in a similar manner as the user APIs. Without sounding
too repetitive, let's look at how the ``POST /events`` endpoint is created and
then we'll introspect the objects created with this API via the ``GET /events``
endpoint.

Take a look at how the POST API is built:


.. code-block:: python

    # fastapi-crud/app/events.py

    from __future__ import annotations

    import datetime
    from http import HTTPStatus
    from typing import Iterable

    import edgedb
    from fastapi import APIRouter, HTTPException, Query
    from pydantic import BaseModel

    router = APIRouter()
    client = edgedb.create_async_client()


    class RequestData(BaseModel):
        name: str


    class ResponseData(BaseModel):
        name: str
        created_at: datetime.datetime


    @router.post("/events", status_code=HTTPStatus.CREATED)
    async def post_event(event: RequestData) -> ResponseData:
        try:
            (created_event,) = await client.query(
            """
            WITH
                name := <str>$name,
                address := <str>$address,
                schedule := <str>$schedule,
                host_name := <str>$host_name
            SELECT (
                INSERT Event {
                name := name,
                address := address,
                schedule := <datetime>schedule,
                host := (SELECT User FILTER .name = host_name)
            }) {name, address, schedule, host: {name}};
            """,
            name=event.name,
                address=event.address,
                schedule=event.schedule,
                host_name=event.host_name,
            )

        except edgedb.errors.InvalidValueError:
            raise HTTPException(
                status_code=HTTPStatus.BAD_REQUEST,
                detail={
                    "error": "Invalid datetime format. "
                    "Datetime string must look like this: "
                    "'2010-12-27T23:59:59-07:00'",
                },
            )

        except edgedb.errors.ConstraintViolationError:
            raise HTTPException(
                status_code=HTTPStatus.BAD_REQUEST,
                detail=f"Event name '{event.name}' already exists,",
            )

        return ResponseData(
            name=created_event.name,
            address=created_event.address,
            schedule=created_event.schedule,
            host=Host(
                name=created_event.host.name
            ) if created_event.host else None,
        )

Like the ``POST /users`` API, here, the incoming and outgoing shape of the data
is defined by the ``RequestData`` and ``ResponseData``models respectively. The
``post_events`` function asynchronously inserts the data into the database and
returns the fields defined in the ``SELECT`` statement. EdgeQL allows us to
perform insertion and selection of data fields at the same time. The exception
handling logic validates the shape of the incoming data. For example, just as
before, this API will complain if you try to create multiple events with the
same. Also, the field ``schedule`` accepts data as an
`ISO 8601 <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ISO_8601>`_ timestamp string. Failing
to do so will incur an HTTP 400 (bad request) error.

Here's how you'd create an event:

.. code-block:: bash

    $ httpx -m POST http://localhost:5000/events \
            --json '{
                      "name":"Resuscitation",
                      "address":"Britain",
                      "schedule":"1889-07-27T23:59:59-07:00",
                      "host_name":"Mina Murray"
                    }'

That'll return:

::

    HTTP/1.1 200 OK
    ...
    {
      "name": "Resuscitation",
      "address": "Britain",
      "schedule": "1889-07-28T06:59:59+00:00",
      "host": {
        "name": "Mina Murray"
      }
    }

You can also use the ``GET /events`` endpoint to list and filter the event
objects. To locate the ``Resuscitation`` event, you'd use the ``filter_name``
parameter with the GET API as follows:

.. code-block:: bash

    $ httpx -m GET http://localhost:5000/events \
            -p 'name' 'Resuscitation'

That'll return:

::

    HTTP/1.1 200 OK
    ...
    {
      "name": "Resuscitation",
      "address": "Britain",
      "schedule": "1889-07-28T06:59:59+00:00",
      "host": {
        "name": "Mina Murray"
      }
    }

Take a look at the ``app/events.py`` file to see how the ``PUT /events`` and
``DELETE /events`` endpoints are constructed.


Browse the endpoints using the native OpenAPI doc
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

FastAPI automatically generates OpenAPI schema from the API endpoints and uses
those to build the API docs. While the ``uvicorn`` server is running, go to
your browser and head over to
`http://localhost:5000/docs <http://locahost:5000/docs>`_. You should see an
API navigator like this:

.. image::
