:edb-alt-title: Integrating EdgeDB Auth's built-in UI

To use the built-in UI for EdgeDB Auth, enable the built-in Auth UI by clicking
the "Enable UI" button under "Login UI" in the configuration section of the
EdgeDB UI. Set these configuration values:

-  ``redirect_to``: Once the authentication flow is complete, EdgeDB will
   redirect the user’s browser back to this URL in your application’s
   backend.
-  ``redirect_to_on_signup``: If this is a new user, EdgeDB will redirect
   the user’s browser back to this URL in your application’s backend.
-  ``app_name``: Used in the built-in UI to show the user the
   application’s name in a few important places.
-  ``logo_url``: If provided, will show in the built-in UI as part of the
   page design.
-  ``dark_logo_url``: If provided and the user’s system has indicated
   that they prefer a dark UI, this will show instead of ``logo_url`` in
   the built-in UI as part of the page design.
-  ``brand_color``: If provided, used in the built-in UI as part of the
   page design.


Example Implementation
======================

We will demonstrate the various steps below by building a NodeJS HTTP server in
a single file that we will use to simulate a typical web application.

.. note::

    We are in the process of publishing helper libraries that you can use with
    popular languages and web frameworks. The details below show the inner
    workings of how data is exchanged with the Auth extension from a web app
    using HTTP. You can use this as a guide to integrate with your application
    written in any language that can send and receive HTTP requests.

We secure authentication tokens and other sensitive data by using PKCE
(Proof Key of Code Exchange).

Start the PKCE flow
-------------------

Your application server creates a 32-byte Base64 URL-encoded string (which will
be 43 bytes after encoding), called the ``verifier``. You need to store this
value for the duration of the flow. One way to accomplish this bit of state is
to use an HttpOnly cookie when the browser makes a request to the server for
this value, which you can then use to retrieve it from the cookie store at the
end of the flow. Take this ``verifier`` string, hash it with SHA256, and then
base64url encode the resulting string. This new string is called the
``challenge``.

.. note::

   If you are familiar with PKCE, you will notice some differences from how RFC
   7636 defines PKCE. Our authentication flow is not an OAuth flow, but rather a
   strict server-to-server flow with Proof Key of Code Exchange added for
   additional security to avoid leaking the authentication token. Here are some
   differences between PKCE as defined in RFC 7636 and our implementation:

   - We do not support the ``plain`` value for ``code_challenge_method``, and
     therefore do not read that value if provided in requests.
   - Our parameters omit the ``code_`` prefix, however we do support
     ``code_challenge`` and ``code_verifier`` as aliases, preferring
     ``challenge`` and ``verifier`` if present.

   import http from "node:http";
   import { URL } from "node:url";
   import crypto from "node:crypto";

   /**
    * You can get this value by running `edgedb instance credentials`.
    * Value should be:

   const EDGEDB_AUTH_BASE_URL = process.env.EDGEDB_AUTH_BASE_URL;
   const SERVER_PORT = 3000;

   /**
    * Generate a random Base64 url-encoded string, and derive a "challenge"
    * string from that string to use as proof that the request for a token
    * later is made from the same user agent that made the original request

      const verifier = crypto.randomBytes(32).toString("base64url");

      const challenge = crypto
         .createHash("sha256")
         .update(verifier)
         .digest("base64url");

      return { verifier, challenge };
   };


Link to built-in UI
-------------------

Next, provide a link to your web application to either the ``/auth/ui/signin``
or ``auth/ui/signup``. Those routes will generate the ``verifier`` and
``challenge`` strings, save the ``verifier`` in a cookie and redirect the user
to the built-in UI with the ``challenge`` in the search parameters.

Retrieve ``auth_token``
-----------------------

At the very end of the flow, the EdgeDB server will redirect the user's browser
to the ``redirect_to`` address with a single query parameter: ``code``. This
route should be a server route that has access to the ``verifier``. You then
take that ``code`` and look up the ``verifier`` in the ``edgedb-pkce-verifier``
cookie, and make a request to the EdgeDB Auth extension to exchange these two
pieces of data for an ``auth_token``.

   /**

    * for an auth_token, setting the auth_token as an HttpOnly cookie.

         res.end(
            `OAuth callback is missing 'code'. \
   OAuth provider responded with error: ${error}`,

      const verifier = cookies
         ?.find((cookie) => cookie.startsWith("edgedb-pkce-verifier="))

         res.status = 400;
         res.end(
            `Could not find 'verifier' in the cookie store. Is this the \
