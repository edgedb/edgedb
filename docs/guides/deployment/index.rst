EdgeDB can be hosted on all major cloud hosting platforms. The guides below
demonstrate how to spin up both a managed PostgreSQL instance and a container
running EdgeDB `in Docker <https://github.com/edgedb/edgedb-docker>`_.

.. note:: Minimum requirements

    As a rule of thumb, the EdgeDB Docker container requires 1GB RAM! Images
    with insufficient RAM may experience unexpected issues during startup.
