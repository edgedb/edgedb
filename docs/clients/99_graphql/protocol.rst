Protocol
========

EdgeDB supports GET and POST methods for handling GraphQL over HTTP
protocol. Both GET and POST methods use the following fields:

- ``query`` - contains the GraphQL query string
- ``operationName`` - contains the name of the operation that must be
  executed. It is required if the GraphQL query contains several named
  operations, otherwise it is optional.
- ``variables`` - contains a JSON object where keys and values
  correspond to the variable names and values. It is required if the
  GraphQL query has variables, otherwise it is optional.

The protocol implementations conform to the official GraphQL
`HTTP protocol <https://graphql.org/learn/serving-over-http/>`_.

The protocol supports HTTP Keep-Alive.

GET request
-----------

The HTTP GET request passes the fields as query parameters: ``query``,
``operationName``, and ``variables``.


POST request
------------

The POST request should use ``application/json`` content type and
submit the following JSON-encoded form with the necessary fields::

    {
      "query": "...",
      "operationName": "...",
      "variables": { "varName": "varValue", ... }
    }


Response
--------

The response format is the same for both methods. The body of the
response is JSON of the following form::

    {
      "data": { ... },
      "errors": [
        { "message": "Error message"}, ...
      ]
    }

Note that the ``errors`` field will only be present if some errors
actually occurred.

.. note::

    Caution is advised when reading ``decimal`` or ``bigint`` values
    (mapped onto ``Decimal`` and ``Bigint`` GraphQL custom scalar
    types) using HTTP protocol because the results are provides in
    JSON format. The JSON specification does not have a limit on
    significant digits, so a ``decimal`` or a ``bigint`` number can be
    losslessly represented in JSON. However, JSON decoders in many
    languages will read all such numbers as some kind of of 32- or
    64-bit number type, which may result in errors or precision loss.
    If such loss is unacceptable, then consider creating a computable
    property which casts the value into ``str`` and decoding it on the
    client side into a more appropriate type.
