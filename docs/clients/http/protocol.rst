Protocol
========

EdgeDB supports GET and POST methods for handling EdgeQL over HTTP
protocol. Both GET and POST methods use the following fields:

- ``query`` - contains the EdgeQL query string
- ``variables`` - contains a JSON object where keys and values
  correspond to the variable names and values. It is required if the
  EdgeQL query has variables, otherwise it is optional.

The protocol supports HTTP Keep-Alive.

GET request
-----------

The HTTP GET request passes the fields as query parameters: ``query``
string and JSON-encoded ``variables`` mapping.


POST request
------------

The POST request should use ``application/json`` content type and
submit the following JSON-encoded form with the necessary fields::

    {
      "query": "...",
      "variables": { "varName": "varValue", ... }
    }


Response
--------

The response format is the same for both methods. The body of the
response is JSON of the following form::

    {
      "data": [ ... ],
      "error": {
        "message": "Error message",
        "type": "ErrorType",
        "code": 123456
      }
    }

The ``data`` response field will contain the response set serialized
as a JSON array.

Note that the ``error`` field will only be present if an error
actually occurred. The ``error`` will further contain the ``message``
field with the error message string, the ``type`` field with the name
of the type of error and the ``code`` field with an integer
:ref:`error code <ref_protocol_error_codes>`.

.. note::

    Caution is advised when reading ``decimal`` or ``bigint`` values
    using HTTP protocol because the results are provides in JSON
    format. The JSON specification does not have a limit on
    significant digits, so a ``decimal`` or a ``bigint`` number can be
    losslessly represented in JSON. However, JSON decoders in many
    languages will read all such numbers as some kind of of 32- or
    64-bit number type, which may result in errors or precision loss.
    If such loss is unacceptable, then consider casting the value into
    ``str`` and decoding it on the client side into a more appropriate
    type.
