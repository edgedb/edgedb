EdgeQL over HTTP
================

EdgeDB can expose an HTTP endpoint for EdgeQL queries. Since HTTP is a
stateless protocol, no :ref:`DDL <ref_eql_ddl>`,
:ref:`transaction commands <ref_eql_statements_start_tx>`,
can be executed using this endpoint.  Only one query per request can be
executed.

In order to set up HTTP access to the database add the following to
the schema:

.. code-block:: sdl

    using extension edgeql_http;

Then create a new migration and apply it using
:ref:`ref_cli_edgedb_migration_create` and
:ref:`ref_cli_edgedb_migrate`, respectively.

Your instance can now receive EdgeQL queries over HTTP at
``http://<hostname>:<port>/db/<database-name>/edgeql``.

.. note::

    Here's how to determine your local EdgeDB instance's HTTP server URL:

    - The ``hostname`` will be ``localhost``
    - Find the ``port`` by running ``edgedb instance list``. This will print a
      table of all EdgeDB instances on your machine, including their associated
      port number.
    - In most cases, ``database_name`` will be ``edgedb``. An EdgeDB *instance*
      can contain multiple databases. On initialization, a default database
      called ``edgedb`` is created; all queries are executed against this
      database unless otherwise specified.

    To determine the URL of a remote instance you have linked with the CLI, you
    can get both the hostname and port of the instance from the "Port" column
    of the ``edgedb instance list`` table (formatted as ``<hostname>:<port>``).
    The same guidance on local database names applies here.
