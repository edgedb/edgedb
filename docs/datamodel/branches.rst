Branches
========

Gel's |branches| are equivalent to PostgreSQL's *databases* and map to
them directly. Gel comes with tooling to help manage branches and build
a development workflow around them. E.g. when developing locally you can
map your Gel branches to your Git branches, and when using Gel Cloud and
GitHub you can have a branch per PR.


CLI commands
============

Refer to the :ref:`gel branch <ref_cli_gel_branch>` command group for
details on the CLI commands for managing branches.

DDL commands
============

These are low-level commands that are used to create, alter, and drop branches.
You can use them when experimenting in REPL, of if you want to create your own
tools to manage Gel branches.
