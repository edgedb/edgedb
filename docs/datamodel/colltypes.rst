Collection Types
================

*Collection types* are special generic types used to group homogeneous or
heterogeneous data.


----------


.. eql:type:: std::array

    :index: array

    Arrays represent a one-dimensional homogeneous ordered list.

    Array indexing starts at zero.

    With the exception of other array types, any type can be used as an
    array element type.

    An :ref:`array type <ref_eql_types_array>` is created implicitly
    when an :ref:`array constructor <ref_eql_expr_array_ctor>` is
    used:

    .. code-block:: edgeql-repl

        db> SELECT [1, 2];
        {[1, 2]}

    The syntax of an array type declaration can be found in :ref:`this
    section <ref_eql_types_array>`.

    See also the list of standard
    :ref:`array functions <ref_eql_funcops_array>` and
    generic functions such as :eql:func:`len`.

.. eql:type:: std::tuple

    :index: tuple

    A tuple type is a heterogeneous sequence of other types.

    Tuple elements can optionally have names,
    in which case the tuple is called a *named tuple*.

    Any type can be used as a tuple element type.

    A :ref:`tuple type <ref_eql_types_tuple>` is created implicitly
    when a :ref:`tuple constructor <ref_eql_expr_tuple_ctor>` is
    used:

    .. code-block:: edgeql-repl

        db> SELECT ('foo', 42);
        {('foo', 42)}

    Two tuples are equal if all of their elements are equal and in the same
    order.  Note that element names in named tuples are not significant for
    comparison:

    .. code-block:: edgeql-repl

        db> SELECT (1, 2, 3) = (a := 1, b := 2, c := 3);
        {true}

    The syntax of a tuple type declaration can be found in :ref:`this
    section <ref_eql_types_tuple>`.
