``FOR``--compute a union of subsets based on values of another set

.. eql:synopsis::

    [ WITH <with-item> [, ...] ]

    FOR <variable> IN "{" <iterator-set> [, ...]  "}"

    UNION <output-expr>

    [ FILTER <filter-expr> ]

    [ ORDER BY <order-expr> [direction] [THEN ...] ]

    [ OFFSET <offset-expr> ]

    [ LIMIT  <limit-expr> ] ;

:eql:synopsis:`FOR <variable> IN "{" <iterator-set> [, ...]  "}"`
    The ``FOR`` clause has this general form:

    .. TODO: rewrite this

    .. eql:synopsis::

        FOR <variable> IN <iterator-expr>

    where :eql:synopsis:`<iterator-expr>` is a
    :ref:`set constructor <ref_eql_expr_index_set_ctor>` of arbitrary
    type.

:eql:synopsis:`UNION <output-expr>`
    The ``UNION`` clause of the ``FOR`` statement has this general form:

    .. TODO: rewrite this

    .. eql:synopsis::

        UNION <output-expr>

    Here, :eql:synopsis:`<output-expr>`
    is an arbitrary expression that is evaluated for
    every element in a set produced by evaluating the ``FOR`` clause.
    The results of the evaluation are appended into the result set.

For details about ``FILTER``, ``ORDER BY``, ``OFFSET``, and ``LIMIT``
clauses see the documentation of the :eql:stmt:`SELECT` statement.

Usage of FOR statement
++++++++++++++++++++++

``FOR`` statement has some powerful features that deserve to be
considered in detail separately. However, the common core is that
``FOR`` iterates over elements of some arbitrary expression. Then for
each element of the iterator some set is computed and combined via a
:eql:op:`UNION` with the other such computed sets.

The simplest use case is when the iterator is given by a set
expression and it follows the general form of ``FOR x IN A ...``:

.. code-block:: edgeql

    WITH MODULE example
    # the iterator is an explicit set of tuples, so x is an
    # element of this set, i.e. a single tuple
    FOR x IN {
        (name := 'Alice', theme := 'fire'),
        (name := 'Bob', theme := 'rain'),
        (name := 'Carol', theme := 'clouds'),
        (name := 'Dave', theme := 'forest')
    }
    # typically this is used with an INSERT, DELETE or UPDATE
    UNION (
        INSERT
            User {
                name := x.name,
                theme := x.theme,
            }
    );

Since ``x`` is an element of a set it is guaranteed to be a non-empty
singleton in all of the expressions used by the ``UNION OF`` and later
clauses of ``FOR``.

Another variation this usage of ``FOR`` is a bulk ``UPDATE``. There
are cases when a bulk update lots of external data, that cannot be
derived from the objects being updated. That is a good use-case when a
``FOR`` statement is appropriate.

.. code-block:: edgeql

    # Here's an example of an update that is awkward to
    # express without the use of FOR statement
    WITH MODULE example
    UPDATE User
    FILTER .name IN {'Alice', 'Bob', 'Carol', 'Dave'}
    SET {
        theme := 'red'  IF .name = 'Alice' ELSE
                 'star' IF .name = 'Bob' ELSE
                 'dark' IF .name = 'Carol' ELSE
                 'strawberry'
    };

    # Using a FOR statement, the above update becomes simpler to
    # express or review for a human.
    WITH MODULE example
    FOR x IN {
        (name := 'Alice', theme := 'red'),
        (name := 'Bob', theme := 'star'),
        (name := 'Carol', theme := 'dark'),
        (name := 'Dave', theme := 'strawberry')
    }
    UNION (
        UPDATE User
        FILTER .name = x.name
        SET {
            theme := x.theme
        }
    );

When updating data that mostly or completely depends on the objects
being updated there's no need to use the ``FOR`` statement and it is not
advised to use it for performance reasons.

.. code-block:: edgeql

    WITH MODULE example
    UPDATE User
    FILTER .name IN {'Alice', 'Bob', 'Carol', 'Dave'}
    SET {
        theme := 'halloween'
    };

    # The above can be accomplished with a FOR statement,
    # but it is not recommended.
    WITH MODULE example
    FOR x IN {'Alice', 'Bob', 'Carol', 'Dave'}
    UNION (
        UPDATE User
        FILTER .name = x
        SET {
            theme := 'halloween'
        }
    );

Another example of using a ``FOR`` statement is working with link
properties. Specifying the link properties either at creation time or
in a later step with an update is often simpler with a ``FOR``
statement helping to associate the link target to the link property in
an intuitive manner.

.. code-block:: edgeql

    # Expressing this without FOR statement is fairly tedious.
    WITH
        MODULE example,
        U2 := User
    FOR x IN {
        (
            name := 'Alice',
            friends := [('Bob', 'coffee buff'),
                        ('Carol', 'dog person')]
        ),
        (
            name := 'Bob',
            friends := [('Alice', 'movie buff'),
                        ('Dave', 'cat person')]
        )
    }
    UNION (
        UPDATE User
        FILTER .name = x.name
        SET {
            friends := (
                FOR f in {unnest(x.friends)}
                UNION (
                    SELECT U2 {@nickname := f.1}
                    FILTER U2.name = f.0
                )
            )
        }
    );
