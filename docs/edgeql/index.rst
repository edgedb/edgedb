EdgeQL is a next-generation query language designed to match SQL in power and
surpass it in terms of clarity, brevity, and intuitiveness. It's used to query
the database, insert/update/delete data, modify/introspect the schema, manage
transactions, and more.

Design goals
------------

EdgeQL is a spiritual successor to SQL designed with a few core principles in
mind.

**Compatible with modern languages**. A jaw-dropping amount of effort has been
spent attempting to `bridge the gap <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/
Object%E2%80%93relational_impedance_mismatch>`_ between the *relational*
paradigm of SQL and the *object-oriented* nature of modern programming
languages. EdgeDB sidesteps this problem by modeling data in an
*object-relational* way.

**Strongly typed**. EdgeQL is *inextricably tied* to EdgeDB's rigorous
object-oriented type system. The type of all expressions is statically
inferred by EdgeDB.

**Designed for programmers**. EdgeQL prioritizes syntax over keywords; It uses
``{ curly braces }`` to define scopes/structures and the *assignment
operator* ``:=`` to set values. The result is a query language that looks more
like code and less like word soup.

.. All told, EdgeQL syntax contains roughly 180
.. reserved keywords; by comparison Postgres-flavored SQL contains `469
.. <https://www.postgresql.org/docs/current/sql-keywords-appendix.html>`_.

.. **Compiles to SQL**. All EdgeQL queries, no matter how complex, compile to a
.. single PostgreSQL query under the hood. With the exception of ``group by``,
.. EdgeQL is equivalent to SQL in terms of power and expressivity.

**Easy deep querying**. EdgeDB's object-relational nature makes it painless
to write deep, performant queries that traverse links, no ``JOINs`` required.

**Composable**. `Unlike SQL
</blog/we-can-do-better-than-sql#lack-of-orthogonality>`_, EdgeQL's syntax is
readily composable; queries can be cleanly nested without worrying about
Cartesian explosion.

The best way to learn EdgeQL is to play with it! Use the `online EdgeQL shell

follow the :ref:`Quickstart <ref_quickstart>` to spin up an EdgeDB instance on
your computer, then open an :ref:`interactive shell <ref_cli_edgedb>`.
