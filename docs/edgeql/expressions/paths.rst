=====
Paths
=====

A *path expression* (or simply a *path*) represents a set of values that are
reachable when traversing a given sequence of links or properties from some
source set.

The result of a path expression is:

a) if a path *does not* end with a property reference, then it represents a
   unique set of objects reachable from the set at the root of the path;

b) if a path *does* end with a property reference, then it represents a
   list of property values for every element in the unique set of
   objects reachable from the set at the root of the path.

The syntactic form of a path is:

.. eql:synopsis::

    <expression> <path-step> [ <path-step> ... ]

    # where <path-step> is:
      <step-direction> <pointer-name>

The individual path components are:

:eql:synopsis:`<expression>`
    Any valid expression.

:eql:synopsis:`<step-direction>`
    It can be one of the following:

    - ``.`` or ``.>`` for an outgoing or "forward" link reference
    - ``.<`` for an incoming or "backward" link reference
    - ``@`` for a link property reference

:eql:synopsis:`<pointer-name>`
    This must be a valid link or link property name.

Consider the following schema:

.. code-block:: sdl

    type User {
        required property name -> str;
        multi link friends -> User {
            property since -> local_date;
        }
    }

    abstract type Owned {
        required link owner -> User;
    }

    type Issue extending Owned {
        required property title -> str;
    }

The example below shows a path that represents the names of all friends
of all ``User`` objects in the database.

.. code-block:: edgeql

    SELECT User.friends.name;

And this represents all sources of the ``owner`` links that have a
``User`` as target:

.. code-block:: edgeql

    SELECT User.<owner;

By default backward links don't infer any type information beyond the
fact that it's an :eql:type:`Object`. To ensure that this path
specifically reaches ``Issue`` a :eql:op:`type filter <ISFILTER>`
operator must be used:

.. code-block:: edgeql

    SELECT User.<owner[IS Issue];

The following represents a set of all dates on which users became
friends, if ``since`` is defined as a link property on the
``User.friends`` link:

.. code-block:: edgeql

    SELECT User.friends@since;

.. note::

    Properties cannot refer to objects, so a reference to an object
    property or a link property will always be the last step in a path.
