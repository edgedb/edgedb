Installation
============

This section describes the recommended way of installing EdgeDB.

The first step is to install the EdgeDB command line tools.

If you are using Linux or macOS, open a terminal and enter the following
command:

.. code-block:: bash

    $ curl --proto '=https' --tlsv1.2 https://sh.edgedb.com -sSf | sh

Follow the script instructions to complete the CLI installation.

Alternatively, you can install ``edgedb-cli`` using a supported package
manager as described on the `Downloads <https://www.edgedb.com/download/>`_
page under the "Other Installation Options" section.


Server installation
===================

Once the ``edgedb`` command-line tool is installed, use the following command
to install the latest EdgeDB server release:

.. code-block:: bash

    $ edgedb server install

Refer to the command manual page for more information and installation options
(``edgedb server install --help``).
