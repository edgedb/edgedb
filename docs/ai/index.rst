|Gel| AI is a set of tools designed to enable you to ship AI-enabled apps with
practically no effort.

1. ``ext::ai``: this Gel extension automatically generates embeddings for your
   data. Works with OpenAI, Mistral AI, Anthropic, and any other provider with a
   compatible API.

2. ``ext::vectorstore``: this extension is designed to replicate workflows that
   might be familiar to you from vectorstore-style databases. Powered by
   ``pgvector``, it allows you to store and search for embedding vectors, and
   integrates with popular AI frameworks.

3. Python library: ``gel.ai``. Access all Gel AI features straight from your
   Python application.

4. JavaScript library: ``@gel/ai``. Access all Gel AI features right from your
   JavaScript backend application.
