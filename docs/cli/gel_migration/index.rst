gel migration
=============

|Gel| provides schema migration tools as server-side tools. This means that,
from the point of view of the application, migrations are language- and
platform-agnostic and don't require additional libraries.

Using the migration tools is the recommended way to make schema changes.

Setup
=====

First of all, the migration tools need a place to store the schema and
migration information. By default they will look in the ``dbschema``
directory, but it's also possible to specify any other location by
using the :cli:synopsis:`schema-dir` option.

Inside this directory, you will find an |.gel| file with an :ref:`SDL
<ref_eql_sdl>` schema description. You may split your schema across multiple
|.gel| files. The migration tools will read all of them and treat them as a
single SDL document.
