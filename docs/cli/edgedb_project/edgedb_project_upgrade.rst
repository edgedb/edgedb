======================
edgedb project upgrade
======================

Upgrade EdgeDB instance used for the current project

.. cli:synopsis::

    edgedb project upgrade [<options>]


Description
===========

This command has two modes of operation.

1) Upgrade instance to a version specified in :ref:`ref_reference_edgedb_toml`.
   This happens when the command is invoked without any explicit target
   version.
2) Update ``edgedb.toml`` to a new version and upgrade the instance.
   Which happens when one of the options for providing the target
   version is used.

In all cases your data is preserved and converted using dump/restore
mechanism. This might fail if lower version is specified (for example
if upgrading from nightly to the stable version).
