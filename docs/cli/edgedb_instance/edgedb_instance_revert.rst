Description
===========

When :ref:`ref_cli_edgedb_instance_upgrade` performs a major version
upgrade on an instance the old instance data is kept around. The
:gelcmd:`instance revert` command removes the new instance version and
replaces it with the old copy. It also ensures that the previous
version of |Gel| server is used to run it.

.. note::

    The :gelcmd:`instance revert` command is not intended for use with
    self-hosted instances.

:cli:synopsis:`--ignore-pid-check`
    Do not check if upgrade is in progress.

:cli:synopsis:`-y, --no-confirm`
