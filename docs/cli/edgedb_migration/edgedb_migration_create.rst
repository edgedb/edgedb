edgedb migration create
=======================

The next step after setting up the desired target schema is creating a
migration script. This is done by invoking the following command:

.. cli:synopsis::

    edgedb migration create [<options>]

This will start an interactive tool that will provide the user with
suggestions based on the differences between the current database and
the schema file. The prompts will look something like this:

.. code-block::

    did you create object type 'default::User'? [y,n,l,c,b,s,q,?]
    ?

    y - confirm the prompt, use the DDL statements
    n - reject the prompt
    l - list the DDL statements associated with prompt
    c - list already confirmed EdgeQL statements
    b - revert back to previous save point, perhaps previous question
    s - stop and save changes (splits migration into multiple)
    q - quit without saving changes
    h or ? - print help

Options
=======

The ``migration create`` command runs on the database it is connected
to. For specifying the connection target see :ref:`connection options
<ref_cli_edgedb_connopts>`.

:cli:synopsis:`--non-interactive`
    Do not prompt user for input. By default this works only if all
    the changes are "safe" unless :cli:synopsis:`--allow-unsafe` is
    also specified.

:cli:synopsis:`--allow-unsafe`
    Apply the most probable unsafe changes in case there are any.
    This is only useful in non-interactive mode.

:cli:synopsis:`--allow-empty`
    Create a new migration even if there are no changes. This is
    useful for creating migration stubs for data-only migrations.

:cli:synopsis:`--schema-dir=<schema-dir>`
    Directory where the schema files are located. Defaults to
    ``./dbschema``.

:cli:synopsis:`--squash`
    .. TODO: 3.0 release
    .. Remove this note

    .. note::

        This CLI feature is compatible with EdgeDB server 3.0 and above.

    Squashes all your migrations into a single migration.
