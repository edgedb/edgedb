===================================
Network Usage by Command-Line Tools
===================================

Generally command-line tools connect only to the database host. But
there are two exceptions:

1. When the command-line tool starts, it checks if its version is up to
   date. :ref:`Details <ref_cli_edgedb_version_check>`
2. The ``edgedb server`` family of commands and ``edgedb self-update``
   discover package versions and docker images and also invoke package
   managers and the docker engine to do :ref:`index updates and
   related data. <ref_cli_edgedb_net_server>`


.. _ref_cli_edgedb_version_check:

Version Check
=============

Version check checks the current version of command-line tool by fetching
``https://packages.edgedb.com/.jsonindexes/*.json``.

Here is how such a request looks like::

    GET /archive/.jsonindexes/linux-x86_64.json HTTP/1.1
    host: packages.edgedb.com
    content-length: 0
    user-agent: edgedb

The ``User-Agent`` header only specifies that request is done by
``edgedb`` command-line tool (without version number). The platform,
architecture and whether nightly is used can be devised from the URL of
the query.

Latest version number is cached for the random duration from 16 to 32
hours (this randomization is done both for spreading the load and for
better anonymizing the data). A failure is cached for the random
duration from 6 to 12 hours.


Disabling Version Check
=======================

To disable version check do one of two things:

1. Use ``--no-version-check`` command-line parameter to disable just
for this invocation
2. Export ``EDGEDB_NO_VERSION_CHECK=true`` in the environment.

To verify that check is skipped and no network access is being done
logging facility can be used::

   $ export RUST_LOG=edgedb::version_check=debug
   $ edgedb --no-version-check
   [..snip..] Skipping version check due to --no-version-check
   edgedb>
   $ EDGEDB_NO_VERSION_CHECK=true edgedb
   [..snip..] Skipping version check due to EDGEDB_NO_VERSION_CHECK
   edgedb>


.. _ref_cli_edgedb_net_server:

``edgedb server`` and ``edgedb self-update``
============================================

Generally these commands do requests with exactly the headers
like :ref:`version check <ref_cli_edgedb_version_check>`.

Data sources for the commands directly:

1. Package indexes and packages at ``https://packages.edgedb.com``
2. Docker image index at ``https://registry.hub.docker.com``

Data sources that can be used indirectly:

1. Docker engine may fetch indexes and images. Currently the only
   images used are at Docker Hub. More specifically
   are ``edgedb/*`` and ``busybox`` (Docker's official image).
2. Package managers (currently ``apt-get``, ``yum``) can fetch indexes
   and install packages from ``https://packages.edgedb.com``. And
   as we use generic commands (e.g. ``apt-get update``) and system
   dependencies, package manager can fetch package indexes and package
   data from any sources listed in repositories configured in the
   system.

To avoid reaching these hosts, avoid using: ``edgedb server`` and
``edgedb self-update`` subcommands. These commands only simplify
installation and maintenance of the installations. All EdgeDB features
are available without using them.
