Introduction
============

    The relational model is still the most effective method
    of representing data. And SQL as a declarative,
    storage-neutral query language is powerful and versatile.
    We donâ€™t need to abandon either. Instead, we build on 
    what works in a language that affords more power to its 
    users, while being simpler and more consistent.

EdgeDB is a relational database that stores and describes the data
as strongly typed objects and relationships between them.

EdgeDB is built on top of PostgreSQL, inheriting all of its core
strengths: ACID compliance, performance, and reliability.
Building EdgeDB this way lets us offer something completely new
while maintaining decades of established practice in the areas 
where existing database software just works.

**What is EdgeDB?** It has:

.. class:: ticklist

- strict, strongly typed schema;
- powerful and clean query language;
- ability to easily work with complex hierarchical data;
- built-in support for schema migrations.

**What is EdgeDB not?**

EdgeDB is not a graph database: the data is stored and queried using
relational database techniques.  Unlike most graph databases, EdgeDB
maintains a strict schema.

EdgeDB is not a document database, but inserting and querying hierarchical
document-like data is trivial.

EdgeDB is not a traditional object database. Despite the classification,
it is not an implementation of OOP persistence.
