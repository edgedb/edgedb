==========
1.0 Beta 3
==========

This changelog summarizes new features and breaking changes in
EdgeDB 1.0 beta 3 "Ross".


Migrations
==========

We continue working on improving our schema and migration tools:

* Prohibit mixing computed and regular links or properties
  (:eql:gh:`#2099`).
* Don't ask for conversion expressions when changing type of
  computed link or property (:eql:gh:`#2658`).
* Fix some migration issues involving rebasing (:eql:gh:`#2536`).
* Fix backlink processing in SDL schemas (:eql:gh:`#1824`).
* Improve migration prompts (:eql:gh:`#2547`, :eql:gh:`#2591`).


EdgeQL
======

* Add :ref:`free shapes <ref_datamodel_objects_free>`
  (:eql:gh:`#2533`).

  This construct provides a way to arbitrarily structure data without
  providing a specific underlying object. It is easier to package data
  that potentially contains empty sets this way, rather than using a
  :eql:type:`tuple`:

  .. code-block:: edgeql

    WITH U := (SELECT User FILTER .name LIKE '%user%')
    SELECT {
        matches := U {name},
        total := count(U),
        total_users := count(User),
    };

* Add :eql:type:`cal::relative_duration`, which is similar to duration
  but instead uses fuzzy units like years, months and days in addition
  to the more standard units like seconds (:eql:gh:`#2559`).
* Enforce :eql:type:`duration` constraints in SQL as opposed to only
  during casting (:eql:gh:`#2539`).

* Implement path-like syntax for accessing enum types' members
  (:eql:gh:`#2625`):

  .. code-block:: edgeql

    SELECT Color.Red;

  is equivalent to

  .. code-block:: edgeql

    SELECT <Color>'Red';

* Allow removal and reordering of :eql:type:`enum` elements
  (:eql:gh:`#2564`).

* Implement :eql:func:`assert_single` which allows to perform a
  cardinality check in run-time (:eql:gh:`#2695`):

  .. code-block:: edgeql-repl

    db> SELECT assert_single((SELECT User FILTER .name = "Unique"));
    {default::User {id: ...}}

    db> SELECT assert_single((SELECT User))
    ERROR: CardinalityViolationError: assert_single violation: more than
           one element returned by an expression

* Adjust the precedence of :ref:`DETACHED <ref_eql_with_detached>` to
  match that of :eql:op:`EXISTS` (:eql:gh:`#2638`).

  This makes it apply to shapes in a more intuitive fashion:

  .. code-block:: edgeql

    SELECT DETACHED User {
        exclamation := User.name ++ '!'
    }

  The above expression will now interpret the ``User`` inside that
  shape as the same ``DETACHED`` User as mentioned at the root of the
  shape.

* Prohibit backlink syntax for computed links (:eql:gh:`#2619`).
* Prohibit "$" as the first character in identifiers (:eql:gh:`#2595`).
* Fix how :eql:op:`??<COALESCE>` works with :eql:type:`tuples <tuple>`
  (:eql:gh:`#2602`).
* Fix cardinality inference of computed links and properties
  (:eql:gh:`#2585`).
* Fix how :eql:op:`DISTINCT` applies to collections of shapes
  (:eql:gh:`#2540`).
* Fix some cases of nested ``UNLESS CONFLICT`` bugs (:eql:gh:`#2555`).
* Fix how nested volatile computed expressions get executed
  (:eql:gh:`#2545`).
* Fix how ``USING`` expressions propagate to subtypes (:eql:gh:`#2543`).


GraphQL
=======

* Reflect :eql:type:`json` into a custom GraphQL type (:eql:gh:`#2782`).

  The :eql:type:`json` values will be reflected into a custom JSON
  type that renders as seamless JSON. Assuming ``additional_data`` is
  a JSON value, here's how a GraphQL query would work:

  .. code-block:: graphql

    {
        Book {
            additional_data
        }
    }

  producing:

  .. code-block:: json

    {
        "data": {
            "Book": [
                {
                    "additional_data": {
                        "dimensions": "6 x 8 in",
                        "# of illustrations": 5,
                        "illustrator": "Alice White"
                    }
                }
            ]
        }
    }

  There's a limitation that in order for GraphQL type validation to
  work JSON values have to be passed as variables.

* Remove the helper ``stdgraphql`` module as it is no loger needed
  (:eql:gh:`#2692`).
* Fix an issue with inline fragments (:eql:gh:`#1800`).


TLS
===

We've implemented `RFC 1008: TLS and ALPN <rfc1008_>`_. With Transport
Layer Security (TLS) Protocol enabled by default, it is possible to
leverage the TLS Application-Layer Protocol Negotiation (ALPN)
Extension for secure and reliable protocol selection on top of the TLS
transport, allowing EdgeDB to multiplex different frontend protocols
like the binary protocol and the HTTP-based protocol on the same port.


Command-Line Tools
==================

We've changed some of the CLI `commands and groupings <rfc1006_>`_.
There are some top-level "frequently used" commands such as
:ref:`ref_cli_edgedb_dump`, :ref:`ref_cli_edgedb_restore`,
:ref:`ref_cli_edgedb_migrate`, :ref:`ref_cli_edgedb_query`,
:ref:`ref_cli_edgedb_info` and :ref:`ref_cli_edgedb_cli_upgrade`. Other
commands are grouped into categories:
:ref:`ref_cli_edgedb_configure`, :ref:`ref_cli_edgedb_migration`,
:ref:`ref_cli_edgedb_list`, :ref:`ref_cli_edgedb_describe`,
:ref:`ref_cli_edgedb_instance`, :ref:`ref_cli_edgedb_project` and
:ref:`ref_cli_edgedb_server`.

Here's a more comprehensive list of the CLI commands:

Bindings
========

We've changed the location where EdgeDB stores credentials and other
instance information, so all the bindings need to be updated to their
latest versions in order to properly work with this release.

* Implement `RFC 1008 <rfc1008_>`_ features for `edgedb-python
  <https://github.com/edgedb/edgedb-python>`_ and release v0.17.x
  driver.
* Implement `RFC 1008 <rfc1008_>`_ features for `edgedb-js
  <https://github.com/edgedb/edgedb-js>`_ and release v0.15.x driver.
* Implement `RFC 1008 <rfc1008_>`_ features for `edgedb-go
  <https://github.com/edgedb/edgedb-go>`_ and release v0.8.0 driver.
