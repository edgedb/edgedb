We would like to thank our community for reporting issues and
contributing fixes. You are awesome! ❤️

Major EdgeQL Features
=====================

* Add a ``GROUP`` statement for performming aggregation
  (`RFC 1009 <group_>`_, :ref:`docs <ref_eql_group>`). The
  output of ``GROUP`` are free objects that contain the aggregated
  elements as a computed link:

  .. code-block:: edgeql-repl

	  db> group Movie { title } by .release_year;
	  {
	    {
	      key: {release_year: 2017},
	      grouping: {'release_year'},
	      elements: {
		default::Movie {title: 'Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 2'},
		default::Movie {title: 'Spider-Man: Homecoming'},
		default::Movie {title: 'Thor: Ragnarok'},
	      },
	    },
	    {
	      key: {release_year: 2013},
	      grouping: {'release_year'},
	      elements: {
		default::Movie {title: 'Iron Man 3'},
		default::Movie {title: 'Thor: The Dark World'},
	      },
	    },
	    ...
	  }

* Introduce global variables (`RFC 1010 <globals_>`_, DOC LINK).
  Globals may be set with a ``SET GLOBAL`` command or via language
  bindings.

* Support access policies on object types (`RFC 1011 <acls_>`_, DOC LINK).
  When combined with global variables, access policies can be used to
  push authorization logic into the database.

  TODO: EXAMPLE?

* Add "range types" representing *intervals* of values
  (`RFC 1012 <range_>`_, TODO: DOC LINK).

  TODO: EXAMPLE?

* Support many more arithmetic operations on local date and time types
  (`RFC 1013 <dates_>`_, TODO: DOC LINK).

* Add ``ON SOURCE DELETE DELETE TARGET`` and
  ``ON SOURCE DELETE DELETE TARGET IF ORPHAN`` to implement cascading
  deletion. (TODO: DOC LINK)

  TODO: EXAMPLE?

* Support specifying ``id`` explicitly when inserting objects
  (:eql:gh:`#3895`). This can be useful when migrating data from
  an existing database.

* Support partial constraints and indexes (:eql:gh:`#3949`,
  :ref:`docs <ref_datamodel_constraints_partial>`).

Other
=====

* Support socket activation to reduce memory footprint on developer
  machines (:eql:gh:`#3899`).

* Introduce edgedb+http, a which tunnels the binary protocol over HTTP
  using JWT for authentication (:eql:gh:`#3979`).

* Support using JWT to authenticate to local instances (:eql:gh:`#3991`).


Bug Fixes
=========

* Generate unique ``id`` fields for each free shape object,
  and don't use an actual in-database object to represent it,
  and make multiplicity inference understand free shapes better
  (:eql:gh:`#3631`, :eql:gh:`#3633`, :eql:gh:`#3634`).

* Fail if local Postgres cluster fails to start.

* add ``cfg::memory`` to base types descriptor IDs table (:eql:gh:`#3882`).

* Fix a cross-type exclusive constraint bug that could allow exclusive
  constraints to be violated in some complex type hierarchies
  (:eql:gh:`#3887`).

* Fix issue wehre server might attempt to acquire one more connection
  than it is configured to permit (:eql:gh:`#3901`).

* Fix use of assert_exists on properties that are being directly output
  (:eql:gh:`#3911`).

* Fix a scope leakage that could cause a link referenced inside a computable
  to improperly correlate with something outside the computable
  (:eql:gh:`#3912`).

* Fix a number of issues with the floordiv (``//``) and modulus (``%``)
  operators where we could return incorrect values or produce spurious
  errors, especially on very large values (:eql:gh:`#3909`).

* Make annotations a valid annotation subject (:eql:gh:`#3929`).

* Expose ``body`` and ``language`` fields on ``schema::Function``
  (:eql:gh:`#3944`).

* Make indexes extend from ``schema::InheritingObject`` (:eql:gh:`#3942`)

* Fix some miscompilations of nested shapes inside calls to functions
  like ``assert_single`` (:eql:gh:`#3927`).

* Fix ``SET TYPE`` on properties with default values (:eql:gh:`#3954`).

* Fix ``describe``/``populate``/``describe`` sequence (:eql:gh:`#3959`).

* Upgrade many casts and functions from "Stable" to "Immutable"
  (:eql:gh:`#3975`)

* Fix linkprops in type filtered shape links (:eql:gh:`#3987`).

* Allow DML statements in free shapes (:eql:gh:`#4002`).

* Allow customizing assertion messages in ``assert_exists`` and friends
  (:eql:gh:`#4019`).

Protocol Overhaul
=================

* A new version of the protocol---version 1.0---has been introduced.
  It eliminates all server state associated with connections that
  do not use transactions.

* Support passing parameters to and returning values from multi-statement
  scripts.
