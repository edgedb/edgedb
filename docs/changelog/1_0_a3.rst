1.0 Alpha 3
===========

This changelog summarizes new features and breaking changes in
EdgeDB 1.0 alpha 3.


CLI
===

The EdgeDB command-line tools are now written in Rust. The tools are
a single binary now and can run on multiple different platforms,
including Windows.

A few more commands have been added to REPL:

.. code-block::

      \dump FILENAME           dump current database into a file
      \restore FILENAME        restore the database from file into
                               the current one
      \s, \history             show history
      \e, \edit [N]            spawn $EDITOR to edit history entry N
                               then use the output as the input
      \set [OPTION [VALUE]]    show/change setting
      \set                     Show setting descriptions (without
                               arguments)

Existing introspection commands have been slightly updated to use a
different way of supplying command options. Commands now also have
long-form names that are more human-readable.

Also, there are a few settings that control the look and feel of the
REPL (and can be changed via the ``\set`` command:

.. code-block::

    expand-strings             Stop escaping newlines in quoted
                               strings
    implicit-properties        Print implicit properties of objects:
                               id, type id
    input-mode                 Set input mode. One of: vi, emacs
    introspect-types           Print type names instead of `Object`
                               in default output mode (may fail if
                               schema is updated after enabling
                               option)
    limit                      Set implicit LIMIT. Defaults to 100,
                               specify 0 to disable
    output-mode                Set output mode. One of: json, json-
                               elements, default, tab-separated
    verbose-errors             Print all errors with maximum
                               verbosity


EdgeQL
======

* Add ``+=`` and ``-=`` operations for use in :eql:stmt:`UPDATE`
  (:eql:gh:`#165`).
* Distinguish ``REQUIRED`` and ``OPTIONAL`` query parameters
  (:eql:gh:`#1352`, :eql:gh:`#1355`)
* Allow tuple arrays in schema definitions (:eql:gh:`73125882`).
* Get rid of ``schema::CompoundType`` in favor of ``is_compound_type``
  property (:eql:gh:`c30c1c4f`).
* Add :eql:type:`anytype` and :eql:type:`anytuple` as proper abstract
  types to the schema (:eql:gh:`affb65de`).
* ``schema::Constraint`` no longer has ``args``, use ``params`` instead
  (:eql:gh:`14cec6f1`).
* Make ``std::Object`` the implicit base type for all user-defined
  object types only.
* Make ``std::BaseObject`` the root type for all object types both
  user-defined and system object types.
* Accept ``1e100n`` format as a valid ``bigint`` constant rather than
  ``decimal`` (:eql:gh:`#1372`)
* Make self-referencing (recursive) aliases forbidden.
* Fix dependency tracking affecting index creation (:eql:gh:`#1181`).
* Fix derivation of link targets in certain cases of multiple
  inheritance (:eql:gh:`52c6b2d4`).
* Fix handling of ad-hoc tuples (:eql:gh:`#1255`).
* Fix incorrect implicit limit injection in subqueries in computables
  (:eql:gh:`#1271`).
* Computables cardinality must now be declared explicitly as
  ``required``, ``single`` or ``multi``. The expression is validated
  to be within the upper and lower limits implied by the declaration
  (:eql:gh:`#1201`, :eql:gh:`#349`).
* Prohibit database names longer than 63 characters (:eql:gh:`#1158`).
* Prohibit duplicate elements in shapes (:eql:gh:`#1368`).
* Implement :eql:stmt:`ALTER FUNCTION` (:eql:gh:`#1433`).


GraphQL
=======

* Reflect "description" annotations into GraphQL descriptions
  (:eql:gh:`#1228`).
* Change the auto-generated type name template to use "\_Type" suffix
  (:eql:gh:`#1175`).
* Fix incorrect reflection of enums (:eql:gh:`#1227`).
* Fix deeply nested insert issue (:eql:gh:`#1243`).


Standard Library
================

* Add :eql:func:`sys::get_current_database`
* Rename ``std::to_str()`` array-joining function to
  :eql:func:`array_join`.
* Rename ``std::to_array()`` string-splitting function to
  :eql:func:`str_split`.


Server
======

* Convert EdgeQL lexer (:eql:gh:`#1178`)
* Convert GraphQL parser to Rust and perform constant extraction
  (:eql:gh:`#1299`).
* Constant extraction from EdgeQL queries (:eql:gh:`#1356`)
* Make it possible to use different EdgeDB servers connected to the
  same Postgres cluster (:eql:gh:`#1197`).
* Protocol: implement ``JSON_ELEMENTS`` IO format for responses
  (:eql:gh:`#1169`).



Misc
====

* Add :ref:`cheatsheet <ref_cheatsheet_repl>` to documentation.
* Strictly type-annotate the core schema module.
* Clean-up and improve schema and introspection code to make the
  internal APIs more consistent (:eql:gh:`#1408`).
* Update the `edgedb-js <https://github.com/edgedb/edgedb-js>`_ driver
  to v0.7.3.
* Update the `edgedb-python <https://github.com/edgedb/edgedb-python>`_
  driver to v0.8.0.
